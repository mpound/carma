**
**  Increment to be applied to Coordinated Universal Time UTC to give
**  International Atomic Time TAI.
**
**  (double precision)
**
**  Given:
**     utc      double      UTC date as a modified JD (JD-2400000.5)
**
**  Result:  TAI-UTC in seconds
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1  The UTC is specified to be a date rather than a time to indicate
**     that care needs to be taken not to specify an instant which lies
**     within a leap second.  Though in most cases UTC can include the
**     fractional part, correct behaviour on the day of a leap second
**     can only be guaranteed up to the end of the second 23:59:59.
**
**  2  Pre 1972 January 1 a fixed value of 10 sec is returned.
