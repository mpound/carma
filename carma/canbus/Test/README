---------------------------
This directory contains several directories of tests for the canbus library.  

Only one of the three test directories contain tests meant for automated
testing - these tests are contained in the StandAloneTests directories...

The DirectCanTest, DioTest and CanIoTest directories contain tests that can
only be executed on a system with Janz CAN hardware - namely the Carma 
CAN/Dio board.  

StandAloneTests - Requires no Janz hardware and contains tests of basic 
carma::canbus class code that doesn't require hardware on target machine.
These tests require cppUnit alien package.

CanIoTest - Detailed test of the CanIo class.  Requires Janz hardware.

DirectCanTest - Detailed test of the DirectCan class.  Requires Janz hardware.
