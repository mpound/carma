/**** REVIEW
 * Reviewer: abeard
 * Comments: Suggest adding an operator= to this template.  
 * Despite the fact that an IPQfileWriter is an <ElementType> via inheritance,
 * it is still necessary for the user to explicitly cast a IPQfileWriter
 * object to an <ElementType> object if he/she wishes to do a blanket 
 * assignment.  E.G
 *  IPQwriter<MyClass> writeIpq_("/name.ipq", 100);
 *  MyClass myObject;
 * 
 *  // writeIpq_ = myObject;        // !Error not allowed!
 *  (MyClass)writeIpq_ = myObject;  // Allowed
 *  
 * Adding
 *  IPQfileWriter<ElementType>& operator=(const ElementType& right);
 * to this template would remedy this.
 *
 *  The default operator= still applies if anybody wishes to assign one ipq
 *  to another.

/**
 * 
 * IPQ (InterProcessQueue) provides a generic way for information to be
 * shared between processes or threads. The queues are fixed in length
 * (number of elements) and width (element size). 
 *
 * A templatized class (or structure) is intimately associated with the
 * queue. All writes are done from the local copy, and all reads go into it.
 * Note that all methods of the input class become part of the methods of
 * of the IPQ class, effectively adding the queue methods to the class.
 * The queue storage is simple, with fixed memory allocation, so the input
 * class should have no pointers - just memory. Hierarchies are allowed,
 * as long as it is done with composition and not pointers. Methods
 * have no effect on the queue storage (it may be dangerous to use pointers to
 * the internal data because it is going to get moved around).
 *
 * ***** DANGER *****
 * ** Any class that is virtual (polymorphic = has a vtable = overrides
 * ** a virtual function) will screw up in subtle ways because
 * ** the pointer to the writer's vtable will get copied into
 * ** the reader's object -> not what you want!
 * *****************
 *
 * The queues have independent read and write pointers. The write pointers
 * are an intrinsic part of each queue, but the read pointers are unique
 * to each instance of a reader. The read pointer is initialized in the 
 * constructor to point to the oldest data in the queue. A writer is also
 * a reader.
 *
 * The constructors can throw exceptions - make sure that you catch them!
 *
 * Example of use:
 * <PRE>
 * Class X {
 * public:
 *     double getA() { return A; }
 *     int    getB() { return B; }
 *     char   getC() { return C; }
 *     void   setB(int b) { B=b; }
 * private:
 *     char   C;
 *     double A;
 *     int    B;
 * };
 *
 * // Make a queue that can contain 100 X's
 * try { 
 *    IPQfileWriter<X> Xwriter("a.ipq", 100);
 * } catch (Error e) { cout<<e; exit(); }
 * Xwriter.setB(123);  // Mess with X object
 * Xwriter.write();    // Write current X into queue
 * Xwriter.setB(456);
 * Xwriter.write();    // Write again
 * Xwriter.read()      // Read the first X from queue (into internal X)
 * cout<<Xwriter.getB()<<endl;  // Will print '123'
 *
 * </PRE>
