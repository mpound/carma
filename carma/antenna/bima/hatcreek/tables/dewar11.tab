cyl 6584, motor 6154
rapid warmup heaters: solder connections, power resistors
heater on stage 3: 2 Minco buttons in parallel, soldered
	through a 4-pin Microtech connector
heater on stage 2: power resistor, teflon wires, no
	Microtech connector

sensors: 47106, 97640, 7388, 6727, 7393 

band B:
mixer 31-011-2 with separate bias tee, 100 ohms to gnd
at room temp, 1 mV = 19.35 uA
HEMT 20, with Pb sheet mounted under lid and folded over
	onto the plate
extra massive .032 thick copper straps from mixer and from
	bias tee to the spider
0.1 x 0.25 diam disk magnet on folded pole pieces

band D:
mixer 31-015A-5 (W20) with built in bias board, 100 ohms to gnd
at room temp, 1 mv = 20.50 uA
0.010 copper strap from back of mixer to spider
HEMT 4 
simple pole pieces, 0.20 diam magnet

changes since last cooldown: changed copper straps from
	3rd stage to spider: these are now made from 0.022 thick
	copper, not 2 thinner strips
