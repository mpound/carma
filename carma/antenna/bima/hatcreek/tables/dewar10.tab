cyl 6418, motor 6584
rapid warmup heaters: stage 1 is 350 ohm pwr resistor, all
	soldered (with weak little wires); stage 2 is 300 ohm
	resistor, wires screwed to resistor but soldered to 
	thermoswitch
heater on stage 3: 2 600-ohm Dale resistors in parallel; 
	resistor on band B has 1 tab sheared off to fit block
heater on stage 2: power resistor, 200 ohms, connected thru
	Microtech connector

sensors: 47102, 96946, 7386, 7395, 22577

band B:
mixer 31-011-4 with separate bias tee, 100 ohms to gnd
HEMT 7
mixer and bias tee connected to spider with 0.010"
	thick copper straps
0.20" diam magnet
19.08 uA at 1 mV bias, room temp

band D:
mixer 31-015A-6 (W20) with built in bias board, not a matching
	network but just straight 50 ohms; 100 ohms to gnd
	front block is labeled 31-015A-7
at room temp, 1 mv =  19.6 uA
0.010 copper strap from back of mixer to spider
HEMT #14
simple pole pieces, 0.20 diam magnet
