cyl 5746, refrig 5746 

rapid warmup heaters: power resistors, soldered
heaters are not in "normal" location; wires are bundled
	separately from bias and sensor wires
2nd stage heater: yes; 300 ohm pwr resistor; wires are
	bundled with heater wires
3rd stage heater: 2 600-ohm pwr resistors in parallel;
	note: this is wire "24" because that wire was short
	in the wiring harness; "27" used for sensor 4

sensor 1: 47101
sensor 2: 97638
sensor 3: 96947
sensor 4: 96948
sensor 5: 22575

mxrname_B = 31-011-9
at room temp 1 mV, 17.8 uA
simple pole pieces, 0.20" diam magnet
separate bias tee with 100 ohm shunt resistor
0.010 copper straps, 0.25 wide, from mixer to spider and
	from bias tee to spider
HEMT 1

mxrname_D = 31-012-6
(this is a 3mm style block with full height WR3.7 waveguide
  at input flange; uses separate bias tee; bias tee has
  100 ohms to gnd)
at room temp 1 mV, 18.2 uA
simple pole pieces, 0.24" diam magnet
heat strap from mixer to spider and from bias tee to spider
HEMT 16

other notes: this dewar has angle brackets on both stage 1 and 2
	to hold cryogenic cables; slots not enlarged
