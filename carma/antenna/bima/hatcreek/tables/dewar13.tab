# dewar13.tab

cyl 7528, motor 7528
rapid warmup heaters: crimp connections, power resistors
  (used often as test dewar)
heater on stage 3: 2 power resistors in parallel, one
   with one tab sheared off; band D mixer has extra
   hole so heater can be installed 2with 2 screws

heater on stage 2: power resistor
