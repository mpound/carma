cyl 5093, motor 5093
this is the long cylinder, so spider is attached from
	the top, rather than the bottom

rapid warmup heaters: crimp connections, power resistors;
	Winchester connectors
2nd stage heater: 200 ohm resistor on radiation shield
	base plate
3rd stage heater: two 600 ohm pwr resistors in parallel,
	one (on mixer B) on copper standoff; the other,
    on mixer D, is screwed into just one hole

sensors: 47109, 97642, 7394, 07390, 07391

mixer B: NRAO block 1001-5, with separate bias tee, no
	100 ohm shunt to ground; .010 thick copper straps from
	mixer and bias tee to spider; no magnet
HEMT #8
at room temp, 1 mV = 3.7 uA

mixer D: 31-015-1; with built-in bias/matching network
HEMT #22
simple pole pieces with 0.20" diam magnet
at room temp 1 mV = 19.22 uA
0.010 thick copper strap from block to spider; no heat
	sinking of coax to IF
