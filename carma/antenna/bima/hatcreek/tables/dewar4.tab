# mixer 31-011-6 was removed on 11 sep 98
# mxrname_B = 31-011-6
# at room temp 1 mV, 19.5 uA
# fancy pole pieces, 0.24" diam magnet
# bias tee has 100 ohms to gnd
# 0.010" thick copper straps from mixer and bias tee to spider

# mixer 31-016-2 was installed on 11 sep 98, tested 14 sep 98, 
	removed 14sep98 (poor I-V curve, lots of leakage)
# mixer 31-016-4 installed 14 sep 98, tested 15 sep 98,
	removed 15sep98 (leakage OK, 2D rise too high, soft)
# mixer 31-016-2 reinstalled with new junction, tested 16 sep 98
	then removed (best trcvr is 70 K)
# mixer 31-011-8 installed with external bias tee (the one
	used previously in dewar 4)
mxrname_B = 31-011-8
# at room temp 1 mV, 18.4 uA
at room temp 1 mv, 19.3 uA  10sep01
simple pole pieces, 0.2" diam magnet
built-in bias tee with matching network and 100 ohms to gnd

# mixer 31-015-3 was used at Hat Creek 97-98; retested 14 sep 98;
	I-V curve has degraded since 19sep97 (series resistance),
	noise temps inferior to 31-015-1 so swapped 14 sep 98
# no sign of SIS I-V curve in Oct 2000 when dewar reinstalled
	on ant 1; removed from ant Dec 2000; Greg examined mixer in
	Sep 2001 - wire to junction broken? circuit board trace from
    100 ohm resistor to GND broken?  not clear what all was wrong,
    but we ended up installing new junction
# 31-015-3: at room temp 1 mV, 20.4 uA
mxrname_D = 31-015-1
# at room temp 1 mV, 18.05 mA
at room temp 1 mV, 18.2 mA
simple pole pieces, 0.20" diam magnet
built-in 150 ohm matching network with 100 ohms to gnd
copper cold strap soldered to midpoint of semiflex cable

31-may-03
use mixer 31-011-6, with separate bias tee, for band B
use mxier 31-016-3, with integral bias tee, for band D; note
	that this is just a filler - it is a 3mm mixer!
