# notes from 03-nov-97 

cyl 6154, motor 6418; this refrig has stage 3 e-beam welded
rapid warmup heaters: solder connections, power resistors
heater on stage 3: 2 600-ohm Dale resistors in parallel; 
	resistor on band B has 1 tab sheared off to fit block
heater on stage 2: power resistor, 300 ohms, connected thru
	Microtech connector

sensors: 47104, 97644, 7698, 7701, 22578
sensors 1 and 2 are mounted on foot of flexible
	heat straps to stages 1 and 2 respectively

band B:
mixer 31-011-5 with separate bias tee, 100 ohms to gnd
HEMT 17
mixer and bias tee connected to spider with 0.010"
	thick copper straps
0.24" diam magnet
18.9 uA at 1 mV bias, room temp

band D:
mixer 31-015A-7 (W20) with built in bias board, not a matching
	network but just straight 50 ohms; 100 ohms to gnd
at room temp, 1 mv = 20.80 uA
0.010 copper strap from back of mixer to spider
HEMT #25
simple pole pieces, 0.20 diam magnet

changes made 02/03 nov 97: changed 2 small magnets on mixer B
	for 1 big magnet; heat strap to mixer B used to be broad
	copper strap connecting to the spider, with heater mounted
	midway along it - now it is the standard arrangement;
	also, I replaced straps from stage 3 to spider with
	0.022" thick copper straps
