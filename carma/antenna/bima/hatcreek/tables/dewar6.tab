# dewar6.tab   29sep97

cyl 5346, motor 5346

rapid warmup heaters: crimp connections, power resistors
2nd stage heater: mounted on aluminum plate filling unused
	HEMT slot
3rd stage heater: two 600 ohm pwr resistors in parallel,
	one (on mixer B) with tab sheared off to fit; the ohter,
    on mixer D, has 2 holes to screw into

sensors: 47103, 402, 6726, 7398, 22574

mixer B: 31-011-7, with separate bias tee with 100 ohms to gnd;
	thick copper straps from both mixer and bias tee to spider
simple pole pieces with 0.2" diam magnet
HEMT #5
at room temp, 1 mV = 17.0 uA

mixer D: 31-015A-1; with built-in bias/matching network
	(150 ohms?); device ?
HEMT #19
simple pole pieces with 0.24" diam magnet
# at room temp, 1 mV = 21.15 uA
at room temp 1 mV = 20.54 uA
0.010 thick copper strap from block to spider; no heat
	sinking of coax to IF

-------------------------------------------------------
01Oct97 - replaced sensor 5 with 22574 because mixer_D
  was suspiciously cold (only a little warmer than 3rd stage)
replaced junction in mixer D with wafer (?, ?)
replaced HEMT 17 (oscillates?) with HEMT 19

04Sep01 - replaced 4 flexible straps from stage_3 to propeller;
  old straps were two nested 0.010" thick copper pieces with indium
  gaskets underneath; new are single 0.020" thick copper pieces with
  Apiezon N underneath; in the past, the mixers in this dewar have
  been slow to cool down following a defrost
- replaced all cryogenic wires with polyimide-insulated wires
- repositioned mixer_B horn; it had been recessed about 1/8" too
  far, so moved forward, also adjusted angle of block a little
