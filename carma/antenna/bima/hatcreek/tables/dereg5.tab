# dereg4.tab
# dewar temperature regulation parameters; program dereg
#	reads this file each time it is invoked
#
# NOTE: temperature setpoints for antenna j are given by
#	common variables TREGMXR-j and TREGAMP-j; these
#	can be changed using the "alter" command; if
#	setpoints are 0, all heaters will be turned off
#
# inputs on each line:
#	ant = antenna number (1-9)
#	stage = 2 for HEMT (or HEMT/Schottky), 3 for SIS
#	sensmpx	= sensor mpx value for atod, to read temperature
#		  (1107,1108 for v/f2, v/f3; 1083,1085 for a/d2, a/d3)
#	htraddr	= heater address
#		  (0x62 for stage 2, 0x54 for stage 3)
#	navg	= number of ticks/refrig cycle
#	nlead	= number of ticks to advance heater by
#	gainp	= proportional gain
#	gaini	= integral gain
#	gaind   = derivative gain
#	active	= 0 to monitor only, 1 to control heater
