NOTE: building and using rtd.jar is changing (eventually the build
system will do it) to using ant from the $CARMA_BUILD root, viz.:
	cd $CARMA_BUILD			(if you have one)
	ant
	scripts/rtd server=acc.ovro.caltech.edu
	

The jar files checked into the "jars" directory below are temporary until 
we have a standard method of handling java for carma. These could be viewed
as static foreign packages. The Makefile will build
the file "rtd.jar" in the jars subdirectory. This jar file has a manifest
that calls out the other jar files in this directory. To run the rtd program,
just enter

   java $(JAR_DIREDCTORY)/rtd.jar

The server defaults to the labacc, but if you want to use another server, do

   java $(JAR_DIREDCTORY)/rtd.jar server=myOwnServer.myNetwork.edu
   
e.g., to use the ovro cma server,    

   java $(JAR_DIREDCTORY)/rtd.jar server=inyo.ovro.caltech.edu
