C++ Realtime window data servers     Steve Scott 9/22/2004

This directory and subdirectory contain code for the realtime window data servers.
These servers are written in C++ and run on the ACC and feed data to java
clients for display.

There is a master window server (rtdmaster) that is invoked by an xinetd 
connection request for the service 'rtdmaster'. This in turn execs a
specific window serving program. 

There are two steps required to set up the xinetd service:
1) Enter the rtdmaster service (port 3100) into /etc/services
2) Place an rtdmaster config file in /etc/xinetd.d/

The code underneath this directory is organized into subdirectories
to make it easier to find for maintenance, but all code will be in
the same namespace.
