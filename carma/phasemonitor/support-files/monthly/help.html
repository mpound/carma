phasemonitor monthly statistics notes		jrf - 12 march 2006
(updated to reflect reality - colby 05Dec2007)
</H2>
</P>
<P>
Phase monitor statistics are kept in the directory
~obs/phasemon/monthly.  This directory contains the routine
cumulative.csh which is run via crontab every 59th minute of each hour.
This allows it to capture the transition point into the following
month without missing the last samples of the day.  The work this
script performs on each run is very minimal.<p>

This script will create a directory, archive/MonYear if one
does not already exist under monthly/archive.  It will then create
or append the day's samples to archive/MonYear/sample.dat i.e.
archive/Dec2007/sample.dat
</P>

<P>
A plot image "cumulative.gif" is generated daily from the current
accumulation of data for the month.  The monthly directories contain the
10min phasemonitor data for that month.  It no longer contains the
the record number (N1) of sample.dat for the beginning of the month, as the
first sample is the start of the month (as determined by cumulative.csh).
The current number of records is a wc line count of samples in archive/MonYear/sample.dat
and written to a file called "N" (this is used for helping generate
nice titles in the plot).  The gif file is copied to the base
directory (~obs/phasemon/monthly/cumulative.gif) for viewing on the
web (<a href="http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/phasemon/monthly">http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/phasemon/monthly</a>). 
</P>

<P>
The plot shows the frequency of occurrence of atmospheric delay values
for the month so far.  A histogram in bins of width 30 microns is
given, along with a cumulative curve showing the percentage of time the
rms delay has been below a given value.  Vertical lines indicate the rms
delay below which 50% coherence is expected for each of the four
standard arrays.

NOTES:
</P>

<P>
This routine no longer cares about the record number info.  You can remove
records at will and allow the script to recalculate the cumulative.gif as
the last_sample_time is generated based on the actual records in the sample
file and the sample file is month specific anyway.<p>

<strike>This routine relies on record numbers in the sample.dat file not being
edited manually.  If this is necessary (to remove corrupt data from the
file for example) the monthly statistics can be recalculated. To do this
remove the directory for that month and set Nfirst to the start record number
for the month. The next time cumulative.csh runs it will recalculate the
statistics based on the data accumulated from that record number on. This
will only work if the sample.dat file is changed during that month,
before the 'last_sample_time' month changes.</strike>
</P>

<P>
To recalculate statics for a month retroactively, run cumulative.csh with
the name of a file that has data only for the month in question, e.g.<br>
<pre>  ./cumulative.csh oct2006.dat</pre>
The script will then create the proper archive directory and plot.<p>
It is possible to gather information about a particular month (lets use Oct 2006) from ~obs/phasemon/data/sample.dat by using the following awk command:<br>
<pre>  awk '{ if ( $1 &gt; 54009.0 &amp;&amp; $1 &lt; 54040.0 ) print $0; }' &gt; oct2006.dat</pre>
The numbers are the MJD's for the start and the end of the month of October 2006.  You can easily generated these using a CARMA utility:<br>
<pre>  timeConvert tomjd="2006 Oct 01 00:00:00"
  timeConvert tomjd="2006 Nov 01 00:00:00"</pre>
etc...<p>

<strike>In order to recalculate statistics for a month retroactively, the
sample.dat data within the MMMYYYY directory can be edited, and
"retrostat.awk" run to redo the statistics and replace the
cumulative.gif file in that directory.  This is preferred to editing the
complete sample.dat file contained in the /home/obs/phasemon/data
directory.  It is recommended that the original directory be saved
intact in case of problems, since it is difficult to recover from the
full sample.dat file.</strike>
