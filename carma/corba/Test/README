This directory contains several examples and tests of the corba::Server 
and corba::Client classes.

For a simple introduction, see tHelloServer.cc & tHelloClient.cc.  These 
apps create, publish and invoke operations on a simple 'Hello' DO.  

A more complicated example is highlighted in the tObjectManagerServer.cc app.
It shows how to create an ObjectManager servant which in turn manages and 
returns other CORBA servants (ala our Antenna API).

More thorough testing and less user friendly examples exist in tNameServer.cc 
and tServerDetails.cc.  

All test apps require running an imr and nameserver.
