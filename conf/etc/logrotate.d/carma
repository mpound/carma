# Logrotate configuration file for carma.
# This configuration handles rotation of both carma logs AND
# carma visbrick data.  Make sure that both directories are
# mounted and visible.
#
# Place this file in /etc/logrotate.d on your logging host only.
# Logrotate is typically executed as one of root's daily cron
# jobs but you might want to verify that this is the case on your system by
# checking for the existence of /etc/cron.daily/logrotate.
#
# For each execution, logrotate will read /etc/logrotate.conf
# which in turn tells logrotate to pick up package-specific
# configurations in /etc/logrotate.d/.  Do a 'man logrotate' for details.
#
# The 'size' parameter is only meangingful when logrotate is executed.
# The program writing the visibility bricks knows nothing about the
# size limit.  The file will grow past the size limit until logrotate
# is executed.
