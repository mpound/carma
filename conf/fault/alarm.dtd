     Capability to stop evaluation based on monitor point value

     This allows you to "chop off" part of the DAG tree based on the
     value of a monitor point. Everything is done with regular expressions
     to allow for arbitrarily complex matching schemes.

     We also allow negation to make certain regular expressions easier
     to write.

     A way to add a variable expansion based on a monitor point name

     This is useful for allowing runtime changeable monitor point names
     in child nodes without having to enumerate every possibility in
     <if> conditions.

     The information from this variable map is passed into the email
     system. This allows the template engine to have some information
     about the state of the evaluation. For example: antenna number
     connected to a downconverter input.

<!--
     A transient (runtime-changeable) condition

     This allows you to change the DAG at runtime using a control system
     command. You will use it to disable large sections of monitor points
     during certain array configurations.

     Monitor Point

     This represents an instance of a carma::monitor::MonitorPoint in C++.
     It is the only thing that has a value and really effects the "good"
     or "bad" state of a DAG evaluation.

     When an <mp> node has children, this effects evaluation. When a "bad"
     node state is encountered, the children are not evaluated, and the first
     bad node in the tree is reported as the error condition.
