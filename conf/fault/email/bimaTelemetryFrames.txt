The real time system has detected that the telemetry frame rate has fallen 
below a critical threshold. 

This can indicate one of several problems. Please verify the following:

a) That the bimaTelemetryHost is running.  Log on to the offending antenna 
computer and type 'top'.  Note the CPU and memory usage of the
bimaTelemetryHost - CPU should be < 25% and memory usage should be < 10%. 
If not, issue a process restart for this process.
 
b) Verify CAN messages are being sent and received from the telemetry module.
Again login and now type 'cansniffer'.  There should be many messages from the
telemetry module (API 144) addressed 'to host' with varying data packets.
If there are only messages addressed 'to modules' and/or the data packets are
all 0xff, there is a problem and the telemetry card and/or vme crate should be
reset.
