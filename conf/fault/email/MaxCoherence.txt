The fault system has detected that one or more antennas has lost coherence for 
longer than 30 minutes.  There are several possible reasons for this error,
including:

* The receiver(s) are no longer tuned or locked.
* A component in the IF/RF chain has malfunctioned.
* The antenna has developed a large pointing offset.
* The script has stopped running.
* The script contains no calibrators (or weak ones).
* The calibrator(s) in the script are not being observed often enough.

If only one or two antennas have a small max coherence value, then please look
at antenna specific causes.  If a large subset of antennas contain small
values, the problem is more likely to be related to the script and calibrator
configuration.
