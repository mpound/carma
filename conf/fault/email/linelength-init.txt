The LineLength system has not been initialized correctly for one or more
antennas. To correct this, you must follow the procedure shown at:

http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/wiki/Alarms#LineLength.initializedN

NOTE: The uninitialized antenna numbers are available on the LineLength RTD
page (look for red initialized boxes). They are also available below (the N in
LineLength.initializedN is the antenna number).
