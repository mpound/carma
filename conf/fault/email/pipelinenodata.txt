The pipeline has been instructed to integrate but is not receiving correlator
data. The most likely cause of this is that the astroband configuration has
been cleared but not redefined via configastroband prior to integrating. This
can be caused by either a script logic error or certain processes crashing.

First verify that there is not an active instance of the integrate command
running with many records specified. This might be the case if for instance
one was trying to adjust delays or something else requiring integrations to be
running in the background.

Next verify that the CorrDataRemapper, WbDataCatcher and SlDataCatcher
applications are running via the processes RTD and processStatus() SAC
commands. If CorrDataRemapper needs restarted, you will need to stop the
current track in both subarrays, and then reconfigure the correlator.
Restarting the current tracks should be sufficient, however you MUST make sure
that they perform correlator setup.

If none of the above mentioned problems is present, this condition likely
indicates a script error.
