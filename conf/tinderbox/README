This directory presents files specific to a build of the carma code base
using the tinderbox build system.  This directory does not contain a 
tinderbox installation; just those files specific to a carma build on a
specific host. 

crontab: crontab entry for a given user to execute tinderbox builds.

build_shellscript:  the primary tinderbox script

carma.buildcf:  specify the environment and commands to obtain carma 
code sources and build the code.

Update 5/6/2005
carma.buildcf now contains all builds including the incrmental, full and tools builds.
