# TreeData.pm - the configuration file which describes the local VC
# repository data.  Only TinderDB::VC and VCDisplay know the
# datastructure contained in this file.  Other modules can only check
# if a string is a valid tree name or can get the list of all valid
# trees through functional interfaces.  Also this file store the list
# of valid tree states.  The TreeState is used as an informational
# message only it does not directly effect the operation of the
# version control system. The TreeState is manipulated via the
# TinderHeader interface.

# This data used to be configurable via the treeadmin interface but we
# do not support that. The format of this data depends on the version
# control system in use and abstraction prevents treeadmin.cgi from
# knowing those details.  I may code a TreeData specific admin-CGI
# script in the future but I do not have time now and the benefits are
# not so clear.  For bonsai users it would be best if the DB stored
# the tree data.  The tinderbox server could download the data from a
# central place when it first starts up, and this down load could
# trigger a registration for email updates of changes to any trees
# which this tinderbox server is monitoring. As long as the data is
# stored in a file, it is safer to have this data stored in VC in its
# own file, in case of problems.  The data tends to be technical
# enough that this file is managed by a Jr Sysadmin and they prefer a
# text editor with CVS to a CGI script and no records.  Also the
# client side build script needs to know how to checkout a tree and
# map tree names to what was checked out, so there is a communication
# issue to work out.

package TreeData;

# This package must not use any tinderbox specific libraries.  It is
# intended to be a base class.

$VERSION = '0.09';


# Each tree is a map from a name to all the information necessary to
# do a checkout of the sources (in this case cvs repository to
# checkout, module, branch needed) and to create a URL to display the
# page (if such a means exists).  Tree names are used as parts of
# filenames so should not contain ' ' or '/' or unprintable
# characters.  You may need to change this datastructure if you do not
# use CVS.

# Who uses tree data?

# Only the VCDisplay and TinderDB::VC know what the internal structure
# of the tree hash is.  All other modules only need to use the name of
# a valid tree.

# Also the client side build script needs to know how to checkout a
# tree.


#------------------------------------------------------------------


# This section describes some functionality issues when using
# VC_CVS.pm and is not applicable to Bonsai users.


# The 'cvs history' command does not give correct info about
# modifications to the repository (types= 'ARM') when passed a module
# name, it was only designed to work on individual files.  If you use
# the -m option you will not find any info about checkins. We leave
# off the module name and take the info for the whole repository
# instead. If this becomes a bother we can reject information about
# updates which do not match a pattern.  In this respect the pattern
# becomes a proxy for the module.  The pattern is stored in
# $TreeData::VC_TREE{$tree}{'dir_pattern'}.  

# There is nothing I can think of to get information about which
# branch the changes were checked in on.  The history command also has
# no notion of branches, but that is a common problem with the way CVS
# does branching anyway.

# What we really want it the checkin comments but history does not
# give us that information and it would be too expensive to run cvs
# again for each file.  The file name is good enough but other VC
# implementations should use the checkin comments if available.

# dir_pattern: Reject all CVS update file names which do not match
# this pattern. This is only used by VC_CVS.pm and not by Bonsai.
# This is a hack to get around the fact that CVS does not always
# understand the module structure, and 'cvs history' will report all
# updates to a repository even for modules not of interest to us.  So
# if you use VC_CVS.pm the module value will not be passed to CVS. If
# the user can describe what is in the module using a perl pattern
# then VC_CVS.pm can implement lost CVS module functionality in the
# perl code.

# module: Although VC_CVS ignores this variable you should still set
# it because it is clearer (a tree is supposed to map to a module and
# branch) and for practical reasons (the VC_Display may use it an CVS
# may allow proper use in the future).


#------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bonsai specific information.

# Bonsai designates one tree to be the default tree and stores its
# state (open/closed) in a different directory.  We note this tree by
# adding an elment to the hash 'is_bonsai_default' which is set for
# this tree.

# If you are using bonsai you MUST use the local format for specifying
# the CVS tree.  Bonsai expects the root to be a directory which
# contains the CVS repository.

#------------------------------------------------------------------


# It may interest you to know we are currently using this format to
# build sets of locally developed libraries.  Each tree is really a
# set of CVS modules which need to be built in some order due to
# dependencies on the modules.  The build script knows how to do this.
# As far as tinderbox is concerned the tree is a single CVS module
# which checks out the whole set of modules.  The rest of development
# thinks of a tree as a set of modules.
