     Note that the RUN_DIR (formerly DEFAULT_DIR) should be the directory
     where applications run from.  If you are using a CARMA build directory
     (vs. install directory) then this must point to that build directory
     in order for applications to properly find their libraries!  This is 
     a common mistake when first using the IMR.

    <!-- The OAD tag (Object Activation Daemon) specifies which machines are
     included in the domain (and are running OADs).  OADs are responsible for
     communicating with the IMR and starting servers.                     -->

        <!-- The server tag defines carma applications (or CORBA services) that
          will be ran from a particular oad host machine and use the IMR.
          The name must be unique for the oad but can be anything descriptive.
          The path attribute is the path name to the executable. The directory
          tag specifies which directory the executable is ran from. 
          The args attribute specifies CARMA keywords and values, they should
          all occur in one attribute.  The optargs attribute specifies 
          additional parameters which will be appended to the command line 
          following a double dash.  It should be used for uncommon ORBacus
          options such as -ORBInitRef NameService=.... type args.  If there
          are no optional args, you don't need to specify the optarg attribute. 
          There are several more parameters that can be specified, but for 
          the most part the defaults suffice.   
          The first server shows how to use substitution for the entities
          defined in the DOCTYPE tag at the top of this file. The second
          server uses hardcoded values. Use of entity substitution will make
          the file easier to use and modify in most cases as the same values
          are repeated over and over.
