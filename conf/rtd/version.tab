# This file gives info on the most recent rtd C++ server and Java client
# version numbers.    The C++ server version is located only in this file.
# The Java client version also coded is in ui/jrtd/rtd/Version.java, so
# it must match what is in this file.
# Add your change as the *LAST* row; this is the row which will hold
# the latest versions.  
# (Alternatively, hash-comment out all but the latest version row).
# Note version numbers are in the form Major.Minor.Patch.  
# If Major or Minor values of the C++ version are greater than the
# Java version, then the server and client are deemed incompatible and 
# the end-user is prompted to download a new client.   
# A newer client is expected to be compatible with an older server.
