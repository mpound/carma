        Help for All RTD Windows

    <h3>
      Overview
    </h3>
    Windows are started with the <b>NewWin</b> menu and replaced by another 
    window with the <b>Morph</b> menu. A window is a set of set of folders 
    (often a single folder) containing cells of realtime data. There are no 
    restrictions on starting multiple copies of a window, a strategy that may 
    be useful for simultaneously viewing info from different folders of the 
    same window. The cells have a rectangular outline and contain realtime 
    data that is refreshed at the same sample interval as the time that is 
    displayed at the bottom of the window. A question mark indicates that 
    valid data is not being received by the monitor system. The sample 
    interval is the same for all cells and can be changed under the <b>Monitor</b> 
    menu. The history of the values within the cells as a function of time 
    begins to accumulate when the window is brought up and will store up to a 
    maximum of 200 samples.

    <p>
      The line at the bottom that displays UT, LST and Local time can be used 
      to ensure that data are being transferred and the display is alive. 
      These times are only updated when a new set of samples is received 
      giving infrequent updates whan a long sample interval is selected. If 
      data are not being transferred the times will often be replaced with 
      &quot;Connection stalled&quot;. In this event, just kill the window and start 
      another. The Local time is from the computer running the Java display 
      and its function is to show that the program is alive locally.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Cells
    </h3>
    Cell selection plays a role in several menu choices and is accomplished by 
    a single mouse left-click within the cell. The outline around a cell will 
    increase in thickness when a cell is selected. A second click in the 
    selected cell will deselect the cell, as will selecting a different cell 
    with a left-click. Selection may be moved forward with the Tab key or in 
    reverse with Shift+Tab. The history of a cell may be displayed in text 
    form or as a plot by first selecting the desired cell and then selecting <b>List</b> 
    or <b>Plot</b> in the <b>Monitor</b> menu. The list or plot will then 
    update as new data are received displaying up to 1000 samples.

    As an alternative to the procedure described above, right clicking on any
    cell will automatically select the cell, then open a context-sensitive
    menu which allows you to choose any of the possible actions described below.

    <p>
      The background color for the cells is used to draw attention to unusual 
      conditions. <br>The general association of colors is:
    </p>
    <ul compact="compact">
      <li>
        Yellow: warning
      </li>
      <li>
        Red: bad, trouble
      </li>
      <li>
        Green: busy, moving or good
      </li>
    </ul>
    A red cell will not trigger the CARMA alarm system unless it has been
    configured as part of the fault system.
    <h3>
      Plotting
    </h3>
    In addition to graphing cell data as previously described, data from 
    additional cells may be added to an existing plot with <b>AddToPlot</b> 
    from the <b>Monitor</b> menu. The new data will be added to the plot that 
    was <b>last selected</b> (had the focus, as shown by an emphasized title 
    bar). If no plot window exists or the last selected has been closed, then 
    the AddToPlot will cause a new plot to be started. The sampling interval 
    of the data is controlled in the <b>Monitor</b> menu of the parent window. 
    Invalid data, as indicated by a question mark, will not be plotted, 
    resulting in discontinuities in the trace. A right-click on a plot will 
    give many options, including <b>Scaling</b>, <b>Print</b>, <b>Zoom</b>, 
    and <b>Save</b>. Holding down a left-click and dragging in the plot 
    defines a rectangle that sets the area to be plotted. The rectangle may 
    not be correctly drawn if an undate occurs during the drag, but the area 
    is none the less correctly defined. Traces may only be added to plots from 
    cells in the same window (including folders) as the cell that originated 
    the plot. There is currently no way to remove a trace from a plot.

    <h3>
      Audio
    </h3>
    Most cells have audio capability that is disabled by default. If a cell 
    has a green outline then audio is enabled. Toggling the audio 
    enable/disable is done by selecting the cell and then clicking the <b>Audio</b> 
    in the <b>Monitor</b> menu. If the cell does not have audio capabilities 
    then Audio will not be enabled when the cell is selected (it will be 
    &quot;greyed out&quot;). Audio is triggered when the cell background is red and 
    results in a quadruple beep once a minute on the workstation that is 
    running the RTD display.
    Note that this audio capability is not related to the general CARMA alarm
    and fault system.

    <h3>
      Folders
    </h3>
    Some of the windows contain tabbed folders that can be selected. The 
    folders provide a way of selecting part of the data from a window, such as 
    a single downconverter from a suite of four. Data for all of the folders 
    in a window are active while the window is active so simultaneous plots 
    and lists can be mixed from various folders. The keypad can be used to 
    quickly switch folders; N moves to the next folder and P to the previous.

    <h3>
      File Menu
    </h3>
    The <b>File</b> menu allows the current window to be printed to a printer 
    or file by selecting <b>Print</b>. Selection of <b>Close</b> in this menu 
    closes the current window while <b>Exit</b> closes all windows within this 
    Java session and exits the RTD session.
