	<h1>SubarrayControl WorkerPool Statistics Help</h1>
</center>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This window provides insight into the carma::control::WorkerPool class. The
information provided includes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Instantaneous Thread Usage</li>
	<li>Time each task spent queued (per-frame and since process start)</li>
	<li>Time each task spent executing (per-frame and since process start)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sampling Methodology</h2>
<p>
These statistics are sampled in a few different ways. Each method is explained
in detail below.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Instantaneous (at each 500ms sampling interval)</li>
	<li>End-of-queue (when a task is removed from the queue)</li>
	<li>End-of-execution (when a task finishes executing)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Instantaneous Sampling</h3>
<p>
An monitor points with <tt>inst</tt> in their name are sampled instantaneously.
This means that they are sampled once per 500ms, exactly at the boundary when
all statistics are being written to the monitor system. These values are only
meaningful for a single frame.
</p>
<p>
Instantaneous values are useful to represent the current number of tasks which
are queued (waiting to be run) as well as the current number of threads which
are executing a task (busy threads). They are useful to detect long-running
tasks as they are running and using up WorkerPool resources.
</p>

<h3>End-of-queue Sampling</h3>
<p>
Any monitor point with <tt>Queue</tt> in their name is sampled when it is
removed from the queue. These numbers are summed up in two ways:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Current frame: these monitor points begin with <tt>frame</tt></li>
	<li>Since process start: these monitor points begin with <tt>total</tt></li>
</ol>

<h3>End-of-execution Sampling</h3>
<p>
Any monitor point with <tt>Execute</tt> in their name is sampled when it is has
finished execution. Execution may finish sucessfully or not. If execution fails,
an exception is raised, and counted in monitor points with <tt>Exceptions</tt>
in the name.
</p>
<p>
These monitor points are summed up in two ways:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Current frame: these monitor points begin with <tt>frame</tt></li>
	<li>Since process start: these monitor points begin with <tt>total</tt></li>
</ol>

<h2>Totals</h2>
<p>
The monitor points provided also keep a historical record of the min/max/avg
since the SubarrayControl process was started. This can be useful in tracking
down tasks which take a very long time to execute.
</p>
<p>
The totals are updated in the same way as the per-frame statistics, except that
they are not cleared at the beginning of each frame: they are maintained for as
long as the SubarrayControl process remains running.
</p>

<h2>Practical Example 1: Long running tasks</h2>
<p>
To make the sampling methodology clear, we will provide an example case. In this
example, there are no other tasks in the queue or executing. The entire
WorkerPool machinery is completely idle.
</p>
<p>
At this point, a single task enters the queue. It remains there for 2 seconds
(4x 500ms frames) before beginning execution. Execution takes 3 seconds (6x
500ms frames) before completing successfully. The following effects are
observed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial state: all monitor points are zeroed or blank</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>instQueueCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 2: <tt>instQueueCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 3: <tt>instQueueCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 4: <tt>instQueueCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 5: <tt>instQueueCount</tt> value is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 5: <tt>frameQueueTimeMaxId</tt> contains the id string for this task</li>
	<li>Frame 5: <tt>frameQueueTimeMax</tt> value is 4000000 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 5: <tt>frameQueueTimeAvg</tt> value is 4000000 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 5: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 6: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 6: <tt>frameQueueTimeMaxId</tt> is blank</li>
	<li>Frame 6: <tt>frameQueueTimeMaxMax</tt> is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 6: <tt>frameQueueTimeMaxAvg</tt> is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 7: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 8: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 9: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 10: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 11: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 11: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 11: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 11: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 11: <tt>frameExecuteTimeMaxId</tt> contains the id string for this task</li>
	<li>Frame 11: <tt>frameExecuteTimeMax</tt> value is 6000000 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 11: <tt>frameExecuteTimeAvg</tt> value is 6000000 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 12: all monitor points are zeroed or blank</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Example 2: Short running tasks</h2>
<p>
To make the sampling methodology clear, we will provide an example case. In this
example, there are no other tasks in the queue or executing. The entire
WorkerPool machinery is completely idle.
</p>
<p>
At this point, a single task enters the queue. It remains there for 5
microseconds (much, much less than 1 500ms frame) before beginning execution.
Execution takes 222 microseconds (much, much less than 1 500ms frame) before
completing successfully. The following effects are observed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial state: all monitor points are zeroed or blank</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>instQueueCount</tt> value is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>instExecuteCount</tt> value is 0</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameQueueCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameQueueTimeMaxId</tt> contains the id string for this task</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameQueueTimeMax</tt> value is 5 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameQueueTimeAvg</tt> value is 5 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameExecuteCount</tt> value is 1</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameExecuteTimeMaxId</tt> contains the id string for this task</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameExecuteTimeMax</tt> value is 222 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 1: <tt>frameExecuteTimeAvg</tt> value is 222 microseconds</li>
	<li>Frame 2: all monitor points are zeroed or blank</li>
</ul>
