<h1>Help for the CARMA Project Database Information Window</h1>

<h2>General Tab</h2>

<p>
The <tt>Timestamp</tt> field displays the timestamp where this monitor data
was updated. It should update every frame unless there is a problem in the
<tt>carmaProjectDatabaseManagerHost</tt> application.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>online</tt> field is set to <tt>true</tt> every frame that the
<tt>carmaProjectDatabaseManagerHost</tt> application is running.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>currentMethod</tt> and <tt>currentMethodStart</tt> fields show
information about which CORBA method is running at the current instant, and
how long it has been running. These fields are only updated for CORBA methods
which access the database. All other methods are pure C++, and should be
extremely fast.
</p>

<h2>Server Info Tab</h2>

<p>
This tab displays information about each server in the MongoDB replication
dataset. The information displayed is identical to that produced by the mongo
shell command <tt>rs.status()</tt>. It should be helpful in diagnosing any
problems with replication to offsite locations.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>timestamp</tt> field displays the time when the information for this
server was updated.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>name</tt> field displays the hostname and port number of one member of
the MongoDB replica set.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>health</tt> field contains a value (0 or 1) which tells you whether
this member of the MongoDB replica set is healthy.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>uptime</tt> field contains the number of seconds that this member of
the MongoDB replica set has been running. This is the amount of time that the
MongoDB server process has been running, not the host uptime.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>ping</tt> field contains the ping time in milliseconds, as determined
by the MongoDB replica set peer you are querying from. In this case, it should
always be the ping time from <tt>sdp.mmarray.org</tt> to the other peers.
Lower is better.
</p>
