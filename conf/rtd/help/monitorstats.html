<h1>Help for the Monitor System Transport Window</h1>

<h2>How the Monitor System works</h2>

<p>
The monitor system is broken into subsystems which represent independent
functional parts of the system, such as an antenna. Subsystems are usually,
but not always, run on an independent computer and may consist of a single
program or several programs (processes).
</p>

<p>
Each process does the low level work of talking to hardware (e.g. CAN bus
modules or correlator CPUs) and generating the associated monitor data.
</p>

<p>
The aggregate of all of the subsystems is the full CARMA monitor system and it
is available only on the central array control computer, known as the ACC. On
the ACC, the data are available to the subarray control programs for their use
and for display in the RTD monitor display windows. The subarray control
programs also make the data available to the python user interface programs
for their use.
</p>

<p>
The monitoring of hardware and the flow of the monitor system data is done on
half second intervals (500 msec), synchronized to the absolute second, which
is called a frame.
</p>

<h2>Internal Details of the Monitor System</h2>

<p>
The monitor data from each subsystem is sent by the subsystem's
<tt>FrameScriberPublisher</tt> (FSP) to the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> process
running on the ACC. This is accomplished using CORBA monitor packets, and
happens every 500 milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>FrameCollator</tt> process assembles and publishes the aggregate
monitor system.
</p>

<p>
At the subsystem level, it is a two step process to generate the monitor
packet that is sent to the <tt>FrameCollator</tt>. The monitor data are
gathered by the subsystem process(es) that are interacting with the hardware
(e.g. reading the CAN bus). When the control process(es) have finished
gathering their monitor data, or at a fixed time after the half-second tick,
the data are sent to a <tt>FrameScriberPublisher</tt> (FSP) process that is
dedicated to that specific subsystem.
</p>

<p>
There is only one FSP per subsystem and it is usually located on the same host
computer as the process(es) that are collecting the monitor data. Only data
that have been updated for the current frame are sent to the FSP.
</p>

<p>
The time of the last process to send data to the FSP is taken as the
<tt>DataWrite</tt> time, and is relative to the integral half second. The FSP
assembles the received data into a complete monitor subsystem and, at a fixed
interval after the half second boundary, sends the monitor packet to the
<tt>FrameCollator</tt> process on the ACC via the CORBA notification service.
</p>

<p>
The delay after the frame boundary for sending the FSP data is defined by a
command line parameter and must be chosen to allow for all the new data to be
received. The FSP publication delays are also chosen to spread out the system
load for efficiency.
</p>

<h3><tt>FrameCollator</tt> Details</h3>

<p>
The <tt>FrameCollator</tt> processes the subsystem monitor data packets from
the FSP's as they are delivered by the notification service, filling in the
received time and putting the data into the buffer containing the complete
monitor system.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>FrameCollator</tt> runs at a specific delay from the half second and
marks the selected subsystems as <tt>Missed</tt> if a monitor packet is not
received within the target frame.
</p>

<p>
If a packet is not missed, then its timestamp (written by the subsystem) is
compared to see if it corresponds to the half second frame being assembled.

<p>
If its timestamp is for a frame in the past, then the packet was either
published late or delayed in delivery and it is marked as <tt>Late</tt> and
not included in the monitor system that will be written.
</p>

<p>
If the subsystem's timestamp is in the future compared to the target frame
then it is marked as <tt>Early</tt> and removed. Early frames should only
happen if the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> is resource starved and can't complete
the frame processing in a timely way, or if the subsystem's time is incorrect.
</p>

<p>
Once all the frames are marked and assembled, the <tt>FrameCollator</tt>
writes out the monitor system to a queue.
</p>

<h2>Multiple Monitor Systems: Raw, Intermediate, and Final</h2>

<p>
The aggregate monitor system (the sum of all subsystems) is called a <em>Carma
Monitor System</em>, with a formal datatype of <tt>CarmaMonitorSystem</tt>.
There are three distinct versions of the carma monitor system produced as the
data are refined.
</p>

<p>
A new monitor system is created for each frame and passed between processes
until all data are final.
</p>

<h3>Raw Monitor System</h3>

<p>
The carma monitor system written by the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> is called the
<em>raw monitor system</em>. The raw monitor system contains all threshold and
validity information.
</p>

<p>
The raw monitor system is missing all data produced by the
<tt>FaultSystem</tt> and <tt>Pipeline</tt> processes. These are added in a
later stage.
</p>

<h3>Intermediate Monitor System</h3>

<p>
The raw monitor system is subsequently read by the <tt>FaultSystem</tt> which
adds blanking and flagging information and then writes it out as the
<em>intermediate monitor system</em>. The intermediate monitor system is used
as input for the RTD displays and for the pipeline.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>Pipeline</tt> needs the blanking and flagging information from the
<tt>FaultSystem</tt> to apply to the correlator visibility data.
</p>

<h3>Final Monitor System</h3>

<p>
The <tt>Pipeline</tt> reads the intermediate monitor system and synchronizes
it with the correlator visibility data for processing.
</p>

<p>
The pipeline monitor data, including selfcal results over integrated records,
are written to the pipeline subsystem.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>monitorPipelineSync</tt> process then merges the intermediate monitor
system and the pipeline subsystem and writes out the <em>final monitor
system</em>.  The final monitor system is used as input to the
<tt>monitorAverageWriter</tt> process.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>monitorAverageWriter</tt> averages all monitor points into three
different timescales: One Minute, Spectral Line Correlator Integrations, and
Wideband Correlator Integrations. When these averages are complete, they are
written as <tt>mpdat</tt> files which are used to construct the data header
for the astronomical data.
</p>

<h2>Detailed Descriptions of various RTD fields</h2>

<h3>Summary Tab</h3>

<p>
The RTD window contains either offset times or counters. The offset times are
in msec with respect to the half second boundary for the frame. The Summary
tab in this RTD window contains the following:
</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Monitor Point</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>RawWrite</td>
			<td>Offset when <tt>FrameCollator</tt> wrote the Raw monitor system</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="zebra">
			<td>RawRead</td>
			<td>Offset when <tt>FrameCollator</tt> read the Raw monitor system as input</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>FinalWrite</td>
			<td>Offset when <tt>FaultSystem</tt> wrote Intermediate monitor system</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="zebra">
			<td>OutOfOrderFrames</td>
			<td>Cumulative count of out of order frames seen by the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> when processing subsystem packets</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DupFrames</td>
			<td>Cumulative count of duplicate frames seen by the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> when processing subsystem packets</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="zebra">
			<td>BadNotifications</td>
			<td>Cumulative count of bad notifications seen by the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> when processing subsystem packets</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>TotFrames</td>
			<td>The total number of frames since the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> was started</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>
These values are followed by totals of various errors across all subsystems.
Because these totals are the sum across all subsystems, they can exceed the
<tt>TotFrames</tt> count if there are continuous errors in multible subsystems.
</p>

<p>
MissedData refers to the data that are sent by the low level process(es) to
the FSP. If no data are received before the FSP publish time then a MissedData
event is recorded. Note that subsystems that send data to the FSP from
multiple sources can have a partial 'MissedData' event when one of the data
sources does not send or sends late, but another data source sends within the
correct window. This type of error is not detected by the monitor system
transport. The Early, Late, and Missed counts refer to the packets from the
FSP to FrameCollator.
</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Monitor Point</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>TotMissedData</td>
			<td>Cumulative total of <tt>MissedData</tt> events recorded across all subsystems</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="zebra">
			<td>TotEarly</td>
			<td>Cumulative total of early packets received by the <tt>FrameCollator</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>TotLate</td>
			<td>Cumulative total of late packets received by the <tt>FrameCollator</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="zebra">
			<td>TotMissed</td>
			<td>Cumulative total of missed packets received by the <tt>FrameCollator</tt></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Subsystems Tab</h3>

<p>
The Subsystem tab displays times and events for each subsystem.
</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Monitor Point</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DataWrite</td>
			<td>Offset of last data received by FSP. This can be negative if no data were received for this frame.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="zebra">
			<td>FSPwrite</td>
			<td>Offset when the FSP data was sent to the <tt>FrameCollator</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CollatorRx</td>
			<td>Offset when the <tt>FrameCollator</tt> received the FSP data</td>
		</tr>
		<tr id="zebra">
			<td>Valid</td>
			<td>Data was received for this frame and DataWrite time is positive</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

</p>
The other columns are counters for the various dropouts along the chain. If
data are not received along the way a time will often contain a '?'.
