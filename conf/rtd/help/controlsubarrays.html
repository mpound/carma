<center><h1>Control Status Window Help</h1></center>
<p>
This window displays control information for all carma subarrays.
Each folder represents subarray information for the named subarray.
Shows subarray status (active/inactive), source, antenna status and correlator
status.
</p>
<p>Note that the reachable status will only return to green if:</p>
<ol>
    <li>An operation involving the remote object is attempted.</li>
    <li>
        The monitor subsystem associated with the remote object is
        &#x201c;alive&#x201d;.
    </li>
    <li>The operation succeeds in being dispatched.</li>
</ol>
<p>
One way to artifically force an operation to be attempted on all presently
disconnected remote objects is to call <tt>s.reconnect(False)</tt>
from a sac session.
