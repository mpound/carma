<h1>Tiltmeter Help</h1>

<p>
The tiltmeter module is responsible for measuring raw tilts used for drive corrections.  The module communicates via CAN.  On 10m antennas the module is located below the alidade within the cone directly above the azimuth encoder.  Important monitor points are describe below and any monitor point in red should be brought to the attention of an engineer.  The remainder are for engineering and diagnostic purposes.

<ul>
<li><b>LR Tilt</b> - Left-Right tilt measurement.  This is the <i>raw uncorrected</i> tilt measurement.  Left-Right is perpendicular to the elevation plane formed by the zenith and beam direction.  Right is positive.
</li>
<li><b>AF Tilt</b> - Aft-Forward tilt measurement.  This too is the <i>raw uncorrected</i> tilt measurement.  Aft-Forward is measured in the elevation direction.  Positive is forward.
