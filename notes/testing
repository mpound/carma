"Large-Scale C++ Software Design" from John Lakos.

I would recommend looking into the boost.test libraray

widely spread CppUnit (I think it's mostly because boost.test is relatively
new).

"Testing Object-Oriented Systems : Models, patterns and tools"
It is a 1200 pages thick brick and covers multiple languages, patterns etc.
