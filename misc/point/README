This is the OVRO VAX "point" program, ported to linux:
(skip to 8) to how to run it at CARMA)

1) needs the intel compiler (8.1 was successfully used)
   but with a GCC3 version somewhere.
   This complicated life on FC4, you'll need to add the flag
	  -gcc-name=gcc32
   to the icc script at the bottom where the exec is done.
   ifort does not seem to need it.

2) the IMSL routine was replaced by matinv(), a miriad routine
   [locally maintained]

3) the C interface code,  uiptime.c, needed major major work
   [no backwards compatibility maintained]

4) a private version of PGPLOT (issues with intel compiler).

   For this pgplot shared library you probably need

	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`/lib
   or
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
   as well as
        setenv PGPLOT_DIR `pwd`/lib
   if you don't have a valid one already.

5) Sample CARMA pointing data and results are saved, so comparison
   can be made with the old VAX program.  This comparison won't
   work anymore with the offset sign now redefined (as of July 4)

6) INSTALLATION:

   a) This program can be run decoupled from $CARMA, e.g.

	astroload intel			(or some other way to get the intel 
					compiler in your shell)

        setenv CVSROOT :ext:$USER@cvs.ovro.caltech.edu:/sw/cvscarma
	cvs co -d point carma/misc/point
	cd point
	make pgplot 			first time only to get the source
                                        make sure you're on the public net
	make libs                       first time only to compile pgplot


	make 				this can be repeated during development


    b) To integrate this in $CARMA, could copy the binary to /opt/rt/bin
       and copy the essential things into a private /opt/rt/lib/point, but
       until the pointing procedure is final (e.g. can we re-use miriad's
       PNT program instead of the POINT program), this space is left open.



7) TEST RUNNING:

   The pointing software currently produces a file optical.data (see /home/obs),
   it needs to be copied locally.  You also probably need to set the environment:


	source point_csh

	./point

   See the 'run1' file for an example dialog. 
   Also note you need the intel environment still for this section. For
   industrial work, see the next section.

   To locally run a test with the old OVRO data (from optical.data). It is best
   to do this in a temporary directory, as files will be generated

	set p=`pwd`
	mkdir tmp
	../runpoint p=$p data=$p/optical.data date=27Jun05
	
	
8) CARMA RUNNING:

   To run at the observatory, the script "runpoint" can be used. It has all
   paths hardcoded for hiigh site work, and you can run it from your local
   directory as follows:

	mkdir point-02sep05
	cd point-02sep05
	/home/teuben/carma/carma/misc/point/runpoint

   Note that it will use default values for date= and data=.
