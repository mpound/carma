<b>Miriad science data flow</b>
<pre>
FLOW: 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 MAW => monDataFiles => AHW => astroHeaderFiles -| 
                                                 + Filler => sciencedataFiles
                           SLP => visbrickFiles -|
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</pre>
 A diagram outlining the data flow is <a href="http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/DataFlow.png">available here</a> <a href="http://cedarflat2.mmarray.org/DataFlow.pdf">[PDF]</a>.
 astroHeaders and visbricks are inputs to the science data products(SDP)
 Filler that creates the Miriad science data. The astroHeaders are created
 by AstroHeaderWriter(AHW) from monitor data which are created by the 
 monitorAverageWriter(MAW), while the Visbricks are created by the 
 SpectralLinePipeline(SLP). The MAW and SLP must run in realtime to capture
 the data, but the AHW and Filler can be run later.
 Some of the monitorData created by the MAW is also used as input to the
 database. The ingestion of monitorData into the dbms is not a realtime 
 process and is completely decoupled from production of the science data -
 the database need not be running to produce science data. 
<pre> 
DISK PARTITIONS:
- acc:/halfsecAcc, 1+TB,  holds frame, minute, astro monitor data.
  Used to transfer data from acc to database; data have no long term use.
  - NFS mounts
    sdp:/opt/sdp          mounted as /misc/sdp
    database:/longterm1  mounted as /misc/longterm1
  -symlinks on acc: 
    /halfsec => /misc/halfsec
    /opt/dbIngest => /halfsec/dbIngest
    /opt/sdp => /misc/sdp
    /opt/longterm1 => /misc/longterm1
- database:/longterm1, 2.6TB (4xRAID5), holds Monitor Point dbms
  - NFS mounts
    acc:/halfsecAcc       mounted as /misc/halfsec
    slpipeline:/visbrick  mounted as /misc/visbrick
    sdp:/opt/sdp          mounted as /misc/sdp
  - symlinks: 
    /halfsec => /misc/halfsec 
    /opt/dbIngest => /halfsec/dbIngest
    /opt/visbrick => /misc/visbrick
    /opt/sdp => /misc/sdp
- slpipeline:/visbrick, 1+TB (4xRAID5), holds visbricks
- sdp:/opt/sdp, 700+GB(3xRAID5) holds astroheaders, sciencedata, 
  Project Monitor Database
  - NFS mounts
    slpipeline:/visbrick  mounted as /misc/visbrick
    acc:/halfsecAcc       mounted as /misc/halfsec
  - symlinks: 
    /opt/visbrick => /misc/visbrick 
    /opt/dbIngest => /halfsec/dbIngest 
    /halfsec => /misc/halfsec

PROCESSES:
- MonitorAverageWriter(MAW) runs on acc
  Input: monitor system shared memory
  Output: /opt/dbIngest/ 
    Reads data from shared memory every half second, averages it, and writes
    it out to disk files in /opt/dbIngest. 
    It must run in realtime or data are lost.
    The data are written on three different time scales, all of which go into
    the dbms, but only the Astro is used for science data.
    o Frame (half second)
    o One minute
    o Astro: matches interferometric data integrations, required
      for Miriad header
- SlPipeline(SLP) - Spectral line pipeline - runs on slpipeline
  Input: Visibility data from correlators and monitor data for headers and
    control from acc, all transported over CORBA network connections
  Output: /visbrick
- AstroHeaderWriter(AHW) runs on sdp; the input are binary, output xml
  Input: /opt/dbIngest/monitorData/slcorrel - astro monitor data
  Output: /opt/sdp/astroheader/
- sdpFiller(Filler) - runs on sdp
  Input: /opt/sdp/astroheader/SLCorrelIntegrated/  /opt/visbrick/
  Output: /opt/sdp/sciencedata/
- mysqld: runs on database.
- monitorDataLoader - runs on database
- monitorDataDeleter - runs on acc; deletes data from /opt/dbIngest
    and /opt/sdp based on list in /longterm1/workDir

<b>Restarting LogParser</b> - This process can fail if
its index file gets corrupted (program bug).  To restart it:
<pre>
rm /opt/dbIngest/logData/syslog2db.index
imradmin --reset-server LogParser --imr corba
imradmin --start-server LogParser --imr corba
</pre>

<b>Notes relating to the 4 disks replaced in acc which is
mounted as /halfsecAcc</b>
<pre>
<<<<< Section 0 >>>>>>
- check which device is actually mounted on /halfsecAcc by type df -h
  This device, listed on the left will be referred to as DEV below
- Before powering down system, comment out DEV in
  /etc/fstab and /halfsecAcc in /etc/exports
- Power off acc
- Insert 4 new disks in slots 2,3,4,5. Slot0 is the upper left
  slot. Slot2 the lower left slot, Slot3 the upper right slot.
  Slots 0 and 1 hold the OS
- Power up acc and hit <Alt-3> when instructed to enter the RAID
  bios setup screen.
- Select the 4 new disks by highlighting them and pressing <Enter>
- Tab to the 'Create New Unit' and hit <Enter>
- Pick RAID 0 (the default) and give it a name if desired.
- Exit the screen.

<<<<< Section 1 >>>>>>
- boot single user mode
- fdisk DEV
  create 1 partition using the entire disk

<<<<< Section 2 >>>>>>
- try the following while the system is currently booted. If it fails,
  try booting in single user mode.(see grub screen on reboot) and then
  type the following.
- sudo /opt/rt/scripts/fixHalfSec
  This takes about 3min, 14.7sec according to the time command(for 1.5TB)
- uncomment lines containing halfsecAcc in /etc/fstab and /etc/exports
- reboot machine

- After acc comes up. login to database as carmadba
- ps axu | grep mysqld
  check to see if mysqld is running. If not:
- /opt/rt/scripts/mysqld start

Section 0 and 1 are only needed when new disks are being inserted.

Section 2 is the fastest way to bring the hosed partition back up
but at the expense of losing all your data. See Section 3 below
for trying to preserve your data.

<<<<< Section 3 >>>>>>
If the partion is hosed and you want to preserve your data:
- boot single user mode(see grub screen on reboot)
- type df -h and look for which device is mounted on /halfsecAcc
  This will be referred to as DEV below
- umount DEV
  if this fails, boot into single user mode(see grub screen on reboot).
- /usr/local/sbin/reiserfsck --fix-fixable DEV
  This takes a minimum of 12min for 1.5TB
- If this fails, it will tell you to do the following:
- /usr/local/sbin/reiserfsck --rebuild-tree DEV
  This takes about 2 - 2.5 hours for 1.5TB
- Take a look at some of the files in the /opt/dbIngest trees. Look
  for odd dates and or very large files(ie. > than the 1.5TB filesystem).
  If these exists, we've found that the filesystem will not last long so
  it's best to follow Section 2 above.
  Otherwise, reboot the acc

<b>Downconverter module freeze or failure</b>
<p>This problem is characterized by a single column in the RTD SpectralDownconverter page displaying '?' and or being unable to retrieve Psys values from the system.  In a nutshell, the solution is to reset the module, preferably by hand but optionally via <b>sac sldc.reset()</b> as well.  Detailed instructions follow below:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Do NOT reboot the Sldc crate!</li>
<li>Locate the offending module in the downconverter rack.  Downconverters are arranged in the racks by band and input.  The uppermost left rack contains band 1 inputs 1-8 numbered left to right, the rack below it contains band 1 inputs 9 - 15, the rack below it contains band 2 inputs 1-8 and so on and so forth.  Thus band 3 input 8 is the rightmost module in the fifth rack from the top of the leftmost rack.  The rack on the right contains Band 5 Inputs 1-8 in the top rack.  I've requested that these racks be labeled.</li>
<li>Take a look at the LEDs on the front of the module, they are labeled 'reset', 'boot', 'pacer', 'cantx', 'canrx', etc.  When the  module is working correctly, the pacer and cantx leds will blink in unison every half second, canrx should blink every ten seconds indicating receipt of timestamps from the linux crate.  If no leds are blinking the module is frozen.  At this stage, you can try hitting the "RESET" button on the module.</li>
<li>Write a bug report or notify James L. and Brad W. that the module is acting up.</li>
</ol>
