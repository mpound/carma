\ProvidesPackage{verbatimbox}
        [2007/03/16 v1.0]
% verbatimbox.sty is based on boxedverbatim environment found
% in moreverb.sty.
%
% It adds the verbbox environment and theverbbox command.
%
% The verbbox environment is just like boxedverbatim, except:
%
% 1) verbbox has no framed place around it; and
% 2) the verbatim box is not output, 
%    but saved in the global box named \savedverbbox.
%
% The command \theverbbox will output the verbatim box most recently
% created within the verbbox environment (that is, \savedverbbox).  
% The [t] option to \theverbbox is made for outputting a verbbox 
% in a tabular environment.  Without the [t], insufficient vertical
% space is allocated above the box.
%
% This routine allows the verbatim environment to be stuffed into a
% LaTeX box, which can then be embedded in other LaTeX constructs.
%
% This routine is useful, because there are many LaTeX environments 
% in which a verbatim environment cannot be simply opened, but
% in which a box can be simply placed (e.g., tabular).
%
% An enabling routine \addvbuffer{}, is available for general
% use.  It adds vertical buffer space above and below the argument
% of the command.  The vertical space added above the original box
% is the length \boxtopsep; below the box, it is \boxbottomsep.  It
% shares some functional similarities to \raisebox, but it is not the
% same.
