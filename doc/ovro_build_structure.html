<h1>Overview of OVRO Build Systems</h1>
Author: Andrew Beard<br>

Version: $Revision: 1.2 $<br>
<h3>Introduction<br>
</h3>
What follows is a brief overview of the OVRO network and build systems.
&nbsp;The purpose of this is to provide a roadmap to those of you who
are offsite so that you may more easily troubleshoot build related
issues and CarmaTools related problems. &nbsp;This may come in handy at
say 8am EST when most of us at OVRO are still in bed :-)<br>
<h3> Carma Tools<br>
</h3>
Ovro uses a sitewide NFS mounted directory to distribute a common
carmaTools. &nbsp;The directory is mounted as /usr/local on any OVRO
linux box. &nbsp;We have two versions of CarmaTools residing at
/opt/carmaTools and /opt/carmaTools.optimized. &nbsp;The
vast majority of carmaTools.optimized symlinks back to carmaTools with
the exception of an optimized ORBacus build. &nbsp;In theory upgrading
carmaTools is as simple as configuring your build tree to use
/opt/carmaTools and then running the install script for the
package from $YOURSANDBOX/carma/conf/opt/newPackage/install.<br>
<br>
<h3> Tinderbox Builds and the<span style="font-style: italic;"> build</span>
User</h3>
All tinderbox builds occur under the special <b>build</b> user and
occur on local disks. &nbsp;Bodie builds occur in
bodie://var/tmp/tinderbox/, dana builds occur in
dana://var/tmp/tinderbox_buildfull and labacc builds occur in
labacc://tinderbox/tindermount. &nbsp;For the most part, the full build
directories should never be touched. &nbsp;The incremental builds on the
other hand need to be maintened occasionally in the form of a make
clean. &nbsp;This cleaning should mainly be done when a new carmaTools
shared library is added to the system. &nbsp;This is due to an
unresolved build system problem in which binaries do not get rebuilt
simply because their link line has changed and it can result in the
runtime linker failing to resolve dependencies on test applications.
&nbsp;Note that you can only login to bodie as <b>build </b>(passwd
same as carmaweb).<br style="font-style: italic;">

<h3> Runtime system and the<span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span>control</span> User</h3>
We have created a special <b>control </b>user for the purpose of
running all CARMA programs from the IMR. &nbsp;The build tree for <b>control</b>
resides in /home/control/carma/build/optimized and installations go into
/home/control/carma/install/optimized. &nbsp;The /opt/rt directory on
each machine is then symlinked to point to this directory so that we
can quickly change between different install trees without changing the
lab.xml file. &nbsp;Speaking of which, lab.xml is currently the main
runtime configuration file for the OVRO test system and consists of
over 54 servers running on 14 machines. &nbsp;This will likely be our
main R1 integration system so it might help to familiarize yourself
with it. &nbsp;Please see <a
 href="http://www.mmarray.org/workinggroups/computing/carmaRuntimeConfiguration.pdf">Carma
Runtime Configuration</a> and <a href="./ImrUsageDoc.html">Using the IMR</a>
for more information.<br>
<br>
For the most part, no development should occur in the <b>control</b>
sandbox and it should only be built when bringing the lab system up to
date. &nbsp;This should definitely be automated soon and I'd recommend a
cronned nightly build and install on the LAST_GOOD tag.<br>
<br>
The passwords for the build and control users are the same as the
password for carmaweb.
