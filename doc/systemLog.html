<h2> 22 July 2005  Steve Scott </h2>
Tagged CARMA tree with CVS tag R4-loberotator, as a mini-release
for the loberotator. The integration report and followup is in the
loberotator work package directory. The loberotator is basically ready
for science. The ability to download phase switching columns is roughed
out in the high level code and the firmware but is not complete or
tested. This capability is being intentionally deferred for 
higher priority tasks.

<h2> 20 July 2005  Rick Hobbs </h2>
Tagged CARMA tree with CVS tag R4-RC1. This is my mini release containing
the following functionality.<p>
Pipeline DO. activate/deactivate all stages. Control Integrations and
Decimations. BlankFlagging is in simulation mode using an extened class
of Amar's CorrelatorPipelineInfo class.<p>
VisBricks are being written out for Athol's inspection. 

<h2> 20 June 2005  Peter Teuben </h2>
Doing lots of optical pointing experiments to get the procedures
nailed down. At 2pm: cvs update and rebuild. Added ants 1 and 5
into the array for more integration.


<h2> 31 May 2005  Marc Pound </h2>
Cvs update and rebuild.  Tagged as INTEG-2005-05-31.


<h2> 17 May 2005  Peter Teuben </h2>

cvs update and rebuild, needless to say perhaps, the connection to OVRO has been 
very stable again since the fixup two weeks ago. Debugging the Weather Station (WS) 
variables, at irregular (?) times their values remain un-updated. This is an issue
at the WS, not monitor system.

<h2> 12 May 2005  Marc Pound </h2>

Cvs update and rebuild. 
Created <a href="CPUtable.html">CPU usage history</a> table.

<h2> 09 May 2005  Marc Pound </h2>
<b>Main Branch</b>

System rebuild &amp; restarted this morning. 
<br>Problems:
<ul>
<li>WeatherHost was forked.  Used imradmin to reset it then restart it.</li>
<li>MonitorAverage is stopped.  Reset and restart don't work, it terminates
with error:
<tt>monitorAverageWriter exiting via an exception: File carma_src/carma/monitor/TagIDAuthority.cc, Line 204: Name not found: Wbdc.Can.Host.nActiveNodes 
</tt>
<li>OVRO drive monitor data are not showing up in the realtime windows.
</li>
</ul>
Actions:
<ul>
<li>Rebuilt java, which hadn't been done in a while</li>
</ul>

<h2> 29 April 2005  Marc Pound </h2>
<b>R3 Branch</b>
<br>
Problems:
<ul> 
<li>Connection to ovro is intermittent. Goes away for several minutes at a time.</li>
After controlSystem restart:<br>
<li> subarrayControl dies with SIGABRT.  No message to alert.log! Steve 
restarted server SubArray1 with imrConsole. See Bug 62.
</li>
<li>
AntennaHandle::setRaDec is sending incorrect coordinates to subsystems.
Always sends RA (rad) = 0.001088 Dec (rad) = 0.0004727.  I checked
this on W3OH and 3C48.
</li>
<br>
Before controlSystem restart:<br>
<br>
<li>Little or no information is going to logs.</li>
<li>
Started sac, tried a couple things like de.selfTest(0) which worked
Got bold and did s.track("W3OH") which hung subarrayControl.  
Had to kill -9 sac.  After that any command in sac hung, and
imradmin commands to Subarray1 server would not return. (Although
the stop-server seems to have taken effect).
</li>
<li>
Not seeing much emulated data in Rt windows.  Are all subsystems
doing emulation properly?
</li>
</ul>
Actions:
<ul>
<li> Restarted controlSystem at 06:35 PDT to try to fix above </li>
</ul>
More Problems:

<h2> 20 April 2005  Marc Pound </h2>
<br>
Problems:
<ul> 
<li>
Noticed database oad was not up despite that it is listed
in carma.xml.  Did controlSystem stop and start but only acc and
corba came back up.  Eventually controlSystem came back
with many instances of the error 
<kbd>
bash: line 1: /opt/rt/scripts/rc.carma: No such file or directory.
</kbd>
I cannot ssh/rsh to many satellite systems, ttsumably the
same ones that caused the multiple bash errors.  Verbose mode in
ssh gets to the point 
<kbd>
debug1: Offering public key: /home/control/.ssh/id_dsa
debug3: send_pubkey_test
debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
</kbd>
and hangs.
</li>
</ul>

<h2> 14 April 2005  Steve Scott/Tom Costa </h2>
<br>Actions:
<ul>
<li>All bima antenna, linelength and loberotator computers are running and
they have been added to the carma.xml configuration file.
<li>The rtd server programs would crash when started by xinetd 
(and only when started by xinetd). 
The problem was fixed by adding LD_ASSUME_KERNEL to the env via the 
xinetd conf file. 
It is not known why this problem suddenly appeared.
</ul>

</ul>


<h2> 05 April 2005  Steve Scott </h2>
<br>Actions:
<ul>
<li>Ovro antennas 2, 4, and 6 have been shutdown for migration to Cedar Flat.
Changed carma.xml configuration file to move some of the non-hardware related
programs to other ovro antenna computers and commented out the rest.
</ul>
<br>Observations:
<ul>
<li>The monitor system had been running and transporting data since 28 March
until the system was reloaded today.
</ul>

<h2> 25 March 2005  Steve Scott </h2>
<br>Actions:
<ul>
<li>Changed configuration file to use shared rather than persistent objects.
Additionally, the imrconfig program was changed so that another pass through
the servants could be done to start them up.
After this change the system would always start up without hanging, 
even though some processes were not running correctly.
</ul>
<br>Problems:
<ul>
<li>The subarray controller program usually does not start correctly on 
system restart. Killing any instances of this process and restarting with
the IMR does the trick.
</ul>

<h2> 18 March 2005  Marc Pound </h2>
<p> tag=INTEG-2005-03-18
<br>Actions:
<ul>
<li>Update, install, tag at 07:48 PT</li>
<li>Installed latest syslog.conf.acc to acc:/etc/syslog.conf
and restarted syslog daemon.  This created new file /var/carma/accLog/alert.log
for critical messages
</li>
</ul>
<br>Problems:
<ul>
<li>Microvax power failure. <br>Solution: Steve restarted them</li>
<li>ovroCanHost not starting up because permissions on 
 /dev/video0 (framegrabber), which get reset after reboot were too restrictive.
<br>Solution: Modify /etc/security.console.perms.  The
video devices are part of the &lt;v4l&gt; class.  See <kbd>man 5
console.perms</kbd> for more info.
</li>

<li>Syslog2db died after the syslog daemon restart. Problem was /opt/dbIngest/logData/syslog2db.index did not include an entry for alert.log.  I don't expect
this error will happen again, since we have finalized the files that
syslog daemon will write to.
<br>Solution: removed /opt/dbIngest/logData/syslog2db.index. It gets
recreated by syslog2Db.
</li>
<li>MonitorAverageWriter dies.
</li>
<li>syslog2Db ("LogParser" server) died with coredump
</ul>

<hr>
<h2> 17 March 2005  Marc Pound </h2>

<br>Problems:
<ul>
<li>Upon restarting controlSystem, the acc OAD did not come up.
Turns out /var/carma got filled up because Trace messages were
turned on in carma.xml and CarmaThread.cc was
writing a Trace message in a tight and infinite loop.  With the
recent change to Trace, traceLevel=8 no longer means "no messages" but
"high verbosity". So /var/carma/log/*.debug
all have millions of lines in them. 
<br>Solution: Modified carma.xml to have traceLevel=0, checked it in
and installed it in /opt/rt/conf/imr.  Logged in as root: 
<kbd>
service sysylog stop<br>
rm /var/carma/log/monitor.debug<br>
service sysylog start<br>
chown control:prgrmrs /var/carma/log/monitor.debug<br>
</kbd>
(Note you should not remove or rename a file that is actively being updated
by syslogd).
monitor.debug had over 2 million lines written to it just today!
</li>

<li>No monitor data flowing from any subsystems.  NTP was complaining 
about not being
able to write to /etc, but according to Paul ntpd was still running
fine and all machines had proper time.
<br>Solution: none. But the problem seems to have cleared itself up
after I modified the trace level.  I suspect that the monitor
system was so busy spewing TRACE messages that the frames always
arrive late.
</li>

</ul>

</p>
<h2> 16 March 2005  Marc Pound </h2>
<p> tag=INTEG-2005-03-16
<br>
<br>Actions:
<ul>
<li> Did full check out and rebuild at ~17:00 PT.</li>
<li>
Added bimaMH processes back in to /opt/rt/conf/imr/carma.xml,
since Colby fixed the bimaMonitorHost bug.
</li>
</ul>
<br>Problems:
<ul>
<li>All CorrelatorSimServers die with the following error:
<br>
Mar 16 17:28:09 wbcor5 CorrelatorSimServer:  {2005} {ERROR} {carma.correlator} {} {carma::util::CorbaUtils::sendNotification: could not obtain reference to proxy push consumer with channel name b9. CORBA::SystemException exception System exception `TRANSIENT' Locality: exception has been received "over the wire" Completed: no Minor code: 0x0 }  
<br>
Solution: Commented out CorrelatorSimServers from /opt/rt/conf/imr/carma.xml.
Real solution needed!
</li>

<li><kbd>controlSystem stop</kbd> complains it cannot connect to 
the machine corba:
<kbd>
[control@acc optimized]$ controlSystem stop

Checking reachability of all machines (takes about 10 seconds)
All systems reachable
/opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem: line 186:  6053 Killed                  ( rsh $USER $ACC $COMMAND )
/opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem: line 186:  6054 Killed                  rsh $USER $IMR $COMMAND
Unable to connect to corba
the time is Wed Mar 16 07:38:24 PST 2005 
[control@acc optimized]$ 
</kbd> 
Nonetheless the imr seems to be properly stopped.
<br>
Solution: none at this time. Steve will look at controlSystem.in
</li>

<li>Upon restart, several database programs dies because /opt/dbtest
could not be found.  Turns out /opt/dbtest has been renamed to /opt/dbIngest.
We had decided to rename this directory last week, but it had not been
made known that this renaming was actually done.   
<br>
Solution: I changed conf/dbms/dbms.conf apropriately and restarted 
<kbd>controlSystem</kbd>.
</li>
<li>Processes on wbcorN fail because imrconfig cannot find libIMR.so.4.1.2
since Orbacus 4.2 was installed on these systems and Orbacus 4.1 removed
yesterday.  
<br>Solution: Orbacus 4.2 installed on all carmatools in public and 
private networks.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>12 March 2005  Steve Scott </h2>
<p> tag=INTEG-2005-03-12
<br>
<br>Actions:
<ul>
<li>
Removed all bimaMH processes from carma.xml. 
They are still crashing and they bring down the system.
</li>
</ul> 
<br>Problems:
<ul>
<li> database machine disk dead (holds db data), 
so all db processes and those running on database machine are offline
</li><li> bimaMonitorHost dies (still)
</li><li> The controlSystem command does not reliably restart the system. 
This may be related to the bimaMH processes as it was reliable before they were
added back in. Need to see how things work with them removed again.
</li></ul>
<br>Notes
<ul>
<li> All ovro antennas are now online again.  
</li><li> All ovro antennas except #5 have the environmental modules installed 
which supplies the time sync to the microvax drive system.
</li><li> All 16 correlator bands of data and all monitor subsystem data flowing to acc.
</li><li> Subarray control successfully commands antennas in both horizon (move) 
and equatorial (track) coordinates. 
</li></ul>
</p>

<h2> 07 March 2005  Chul Gwon </h2>

<br>Problems:
<ul>
  <li>Following processes did not start correctly with
  /opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem start:
    <ul>
      <li>LogParser (bug 48)</li>
      <li>MonitorLoader </li>
      <li>MonitorDeleter (bug 50) </li>
      <li>MonitorAverageWriter (bug 49) </li>
    </ul>
    Bug information is added - it seems that they are all somehow
    related to the DB configuration.</li>
   <li>Following machines (and therefore OADs) were down:
    <ul>
      <li>ovro1
      <li>ovro2
    </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<br>Actions:
<ul>
  <li>Athol contacted me saying he would make changes to the DB
  configuration today or tomorrow.</li>
  <li>Marc believes that the fix for
  LogParser/MonitorLoader/MonitorDeleter is to have the
  /opt/dbtest/monitorData directory exported to database.carma.pvt -
  will talk to Paul about setting this up
  </li>
  <li>No action taken for machines that were down
  </li>
</ul>

<br>Notes
<ul>
  <li> Had troubles running "/opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem start" on
  dana, and later on acc.  Still inconsistent behavior for starting
  processes not listed above in "Problems".
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> 04 March 2005  Steve Scott </h2>
<p> tag=INTEG_2005_03_04
<br>
Added back in all the bima processes to the system, giving 127 total processes.
<br>Actions:
<ul>
<li>
Athol updated the monitor database, but monitorAverageWriter 
still finds data it doesn't like.</LI>
<li>
The rtd windows were broken because Logger wrote a message to stdout and
a RuntimeDirs trace message that was printed out. Both fixed.</LI>
</ul> 
<br>Problems:
<ul>
<li> bimaMonitorHost dies</LI>
<li> monitorAverageWriter complains of MP:Weather.ambientTemperature</LI>
<li> The monitorAverageWriter in using the dbms for tagIDs but the log 
 indicateds that others are creating them on the fly </LI>
<li> syslog2Db dies because file not there. 
Think this file should be written by acc on file that is nfs exported and then
mounted by database. Imagine export got removed in os reinstall this week.</LI>
<li> subarray control was up and responsive to query commands, 
but died when given move command.</LI>
</ul>
<br>Notes
<ul>
<li> Monitor system shows all systems have mpml and FSPs. All but bima ants,
loref, linelength are publishing (from dumpMonitor stats=t). </LI>
<li> All 16 correlator bands flowing (from pipeline rtd window).</LI>
<LI> RTD windows up and running.</LI>
<li> ovro ant#2 is down (think power is off because of welding)</LI>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> 03 March 2005  Andy Beard </h2>
<p> WEEKLY_2_22_2005_STABLE - Somewhat stable system [see bugs 47-50] but not
thoroughly verified.  Did verify that monitor data flowed through the 
active subystems for the tag.  Verified that data was being displayed on 
CARMA Real-Time display windows.  Did not verify control system.
