This file is for notes about non-DO testing during R3.  
Just add a section with notes about your testing methods
and results.

 Optical Pointing on OVRO Antennas  - Marc

Tue May  3 11:47:38 EDT 2005

I am unable to command the camera once I get a reference to it.
A corba transient error results on selectAperture().

>>> c=Camera(Ovro(3),s)
>>> c.on()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "/home/control/carma/install/optimized/scripts/python/camera.py", line 92, in on
    self.ant_.drive().selectAperture(carma.antenna.common.DriveControl.OPTICAL)

    return _omnipy.invoke(self, "selectA

Problem above fixed.  Optical pointing now passes tests.
Note to run CARMA's camera.py, imported by subarrayControl,
your system must have several tk*.h and X11/*.h files on
/usr/include.  Thus you must have tk-devel and X11-devel
packages installed.  If you do not have these, then
CARMA_TOOLS/lib/python2.3/lib-dynload/_tkinter.so does not
get built, and subarrayControl will fail to import camera.py.

 Weather - Rick

Ran ./scripts/rtd and opened Weather window. Timestamp usually displays
a ? and sometimes displays ******* The other quantities don't change.
Ambient Temp = -17.778
Dewpoint Temp = -17.778
Pressure = 880.000
Humidity = 100.000
Wind Direction = 225.5
Wind Speed = 2.128

getMpFromDb command line testing - Rick Hobbs

Wed May  4 14:47:52 PDT 2005

Tried running program as follows:


% time bin/getMpFromDb mp="WbcBand1*" start="2005-May-04 21:35:00" end="2005-May-04 21:35:01" singletable=false

First time took a bit over 25minutes. Thereafter only a little over 1min.
Descriptions printed out when using --keywords could be a bit more
explanatory(ie. saying quotes are needed for the time keywords and pattern
matching.

Very nice example shown when using the --usage keyword so maybe it's no
big deal being that verbose in the --keywords.

When date/time is printed out, the half-seconds are not printed. It might
be nice to print out times in half-seconds to allow for easy cut-paste into
plotting programs(ie. unix time)

WbcBand1.Dig1.timestamp does not show enough digits. This value is a double.
WbcBand1.Dig1.sequenceNumber is a long and is displayed as a real.


NOTE; this program must be run on the database machine.

 CDV

 It is necessary to have the hostname of your machine match the name
 that the outside world sees (I believe mine is not set because I do
 not have eth0 activated at boot time).  If these do not line up, then
 the notserv will become confused when talking with your machine (this
 only affects passive concurrency models -- that is, pull suppliers or
 push consumers).

 Tests done:
 - started CDV (calling scripts/cdv from the build area)
 - connected to different channels
   * go to "Data Sources" and select "Find"
   * press "Connect" (should be defaulted to corba.carma.pvt:20000)
   * under "Corba Data Sources", open the "carma" menu, 
     then the "correlator" menu
   * select any Band (default is Band6)
   * leaving "Corba Data Sources" window open, go to "CARMA Cw Plot"
      - go to menu matching selected Band
        + go to "Antenna" menu
      	  o select "(3)USB+LSB+AUTO"
        + go to "Baseline" menu
          o select "(3) Combined Plot"
 - switched Look and Feel (L&F menu item)
 - verified that data was being received
