<H1> CARMA installation</H1>

The CST (CARMA Software Toolkit) consists of a the <B>CARMA</B> source code (developed
under our CVS) and a number of <I>alien</I> packages that are needed 
(typically libraries, but not always) to compile and complete linking the CARMA code.
In tar ball form these are referred to as <B>carma_pkg</B>, and once installed,
they are referred to as <B>carma_tools</B>.


<H1> Pre-conditions </H1>

Baselines for installation (some variations on this <I>may</I> also work, but
normallly we mean the version listed or above):

<UL>
<LI> A redhat 9 linux box with various development tools installed)
<pre>
  - autoconf            * 2.59  (notice you need to upgrade)  [autoconf-2.57-3]
  - automake            * 1.8.2 (notice you need to upgrade)  [automake-1.6.3-5]
  - gnu make		* 3.80 (notice you need to upgrade) (Stallman's 1998 book is on version 3.77) [make-3.79.1-17]
  - C/C++ compiler	* 3.2.2 (gnu)[gcc-3.2.2-5]
  - fortran compiler	* 3.2.2 (gnu) [gcc-g77-3.2.2-5]
  - java		* 1.4   (needs a sdk, not jre, see e.g. www.blackdown.org)
  - doxygen		  1.2.14 [doxygen-1.2.18-3]
  - kernel                2.4.20 (note a kernel.org kernel is needed, the redhat kernel has flaws)
                          2.4.23 also works
</pre>
<LI> A $CARMA_PKG directory where all the tarballs for alien packages
are located. carma itself is
also allowed to reside here in case you don't have a network/CVS connection
(think your classic CD install at 35,000ft), 
</UL>

Installation is based on a build tree that points to a CVS source tree
(you can thus have multiple build trees with different configurations)


which should install the carma_tools (all external packages) if you
don't have them yet, followed by a carma installation. Although *both*
can be installed in a single directory, say /opt/carma, it is
recommended to install them under separate directories. 

<H1> Installation </H1>

<pre>
CVS usage:      you will always need a developers account, either use the -d flag to cvs, 
                or set the environment variable CVSROOT.  The 'root' shell variable is set here 
                for convenience, to denote from where we install CARMA and friends.

	1% setenv CVSROOT :ext:$USER@cvs.ovro.caltech.edu:/sw/cvscarma
        1% setenv CVS_RSH ssh
	2% set root=`pwd`

??	 % setenv CARMA_PKG    $root/carma_pkg        
??	 % setenv CARMA_TOOLS  $root/carma_tools
??	 % setenv CARMA        $root/carma_cvs
??       % setenv CARMA_BUILD  $root/carma_build
??       % setenv CARMA_RT     $root/carma_rt

scenario 1:	got absolutely nothing, starting from scratch....

        3% cvs -Q co -d $CARMA carma
	4% cd $CARMA/conf/
	5% ./carma-package-sync slave=$root/carma_pkg

	  IFF you do not have the correct versions of make/gcc/autoconf/automake, you
	  should now use the following commands to install them in the proper 
	  place (the order is important for the auto-tools, but probably not
	  if you between the three make/c++/auto-tools

	6% cd $CARMA/conf/opt
	6% (cd make; make all PREFIX=$CARMA_TOOLS) 
	6% (cd c++; make all PREFIX=$CARMA_TOOLS) 
	7% (cd autoconf; make all PREFIX=$CARMA_TOOLS)

	   Modify search path so that the new tools are picked up:

	 % set path=(. $CARMA_TOOLS/bin $path); rehash        # csh/tcsh
	 $ PATH=".:$CARMA_TOOLS/bin:$PATH" ; export PATH      # sh/bash

	8% (cd automake; make all PREFIX=$CARMA_TOOLS)
        9% (cd java; make all PREFIX=$root/java)              # TBA 
	   javac -
	   ## install_aliens should do a which on javac !!!!

	9% rehash


	  NOW continue on to install the normal carma tools we need:

       10% ./install_tools carma_pkg=$CARMA_PKG carma_tools=$CARMA_TOOLS >& ../install_tools.log

          (this normally very verbose step takes several hours on P4 class machine)

	  CONTINUE to step 15, or discard the current $CARMA

scenario 2:    install carma and carma_tools, assuming carma_pkg is available

       11% cvs -Q co -d $CARMA carma
       12% cd $CARMA/conf/
       13% ./install_tools carma_pkg=$CARMA_PKG carma_tools=$CARMA_TOOLS

	  NOW continue to step 15, or discard the current $CARMA

scenario 3:    install only carma, assuming carma_tools had been done before or is
               available on site.
               This is what most developers will be using most of the time.

       14% cvs -Q co -d $CARMA carma              # can take 2-20 minutes
       15% cd $CARMA
       16% autoreconf -i -s
       17% mkdir $CARMA_BUILD
       18% cd $CARMA_BUILD
       19% $CARMA/configure --with-carma-tools=$CARMA_TOOLS --with-java-home=$JAVA_HOME --with-prefix=$CARMA_RT
       20% make all                               # takes about 30 minutes on a P1.6/768M)
       21% make check                             # takes about 25 minutes on a P1.6/768M)
       22% make html pdf ps
       23% make install
	
</pre>

<H1> Runtime </H1>

You probably want root access on the machine(s) carma is running on. For example, efficient logging
requires a directory {\tt /var/carma}, which is controlled by {\tt /etc/syslog.conf}. See
the directory {\tt CARMA/conf/etc/} for pointers which files to update:
<pre>
   /etc/syslog.conf                  logging, also need /var/carma tree
   /etc/services                     3100/tcp for rtdmaster
</pre>

To properly setup syslog to handle log messages that will be passed into rtdlog and saved as flat files to disk, you must add the following lines to /etc/syslog.conf:
<pre>
# Log local[2-6] with level>=crit
local1.crit;\
local2.crit;\
local3.crit;\
local4.crit;\
local5.crit;\
local6.crit				/var/carma/log/alert.log
local6.crit				|/var/carma/log/alert.pipe

# local1 Receivers
local1.info;local1.!crit		/var/carma/log/receivers.log
local1.info;local1.!crit		|/var/carma/log/receivers.pipe
local1.debug;local1.!info		/var/carma/log/receivers.debug

# local2 catch-all for carma
local2.info;local2.!crit		/var/carma/log/carma.log
local2.info;local2.!crit		|/var/carma/log/carma.pipe
local2.debug;local2.!info		/var/carma/log/carma.debug

# local3 monitor and fault system
local3.info;local3.!crit		/var/carma/log/monitor.log
local3.info;local3.!crit		|/var/carma/log/monitor.pipe
local3.debug;local3.!info		/var/carma/log/monitor.debug

# local4 control
local4.info;local4.!crit		/var/carma/log/control.log
local4.info;local4.!crit		|/var/carma/log/control.pipe
local4.debug;local4.!info		/var/carma/log/control.debug

# local5 correlator, delay engine, lobe rotator
local5.info;local5.!crit		/var/carma/log/interferometry.log
local5.info;local5.!crit		|/var/carma/log/interferometry.pipe
local5.debug;local5.!info		/var/carma/log/interferometry.debug

# local6 Phase monitor, WVR, Weather station, Linelength, LO Reference
local6.info;local6.!crit		/var/carma/log/environment.log
local6.info;local6.!crit		|/var/carma/log/environment.pipe
local6.debug;local6.!info		/var/carma/log/environment.debug
</pre>

After making these modifications to /etc/syslog.conf, you should copy the CARMA/conf/etc/syslog2carmalog script into /etc/init.d, then run the following commands as root:
<pre>
  /sbin/chkconfig --add syslog2carmalog
  /etc/init.d/syslog2carmalog initialize
</pre>

The output of the intialize step should look like:
<pre>
  Checking /etc/syslog.conf file:                          [  OK  ]
  Initializing FIFO's for syslog2carmalog: 
   Created FIFO: /var/carma/log/carma.pipe                 [  OK  ]
   Created FIFO: /var/carma/log/control.pipe               [  OK  ]
   Created FIFO: /var/carma/log/environment.pipe           [  OK  ]
   Created FIFO: /var/carma/log/receivers.pipe             [  OK  ]
   Created FIFO: /var/carma/log/alert.pipe                 [  OK  ]
   Created FIFO: /var/carma/log/monitor.pipe               [  OK  ]
   Created FIFO: /var/carma/log/interferometry.pipe        [  OK  ]
</pre>

Now you should restart the syslog daemon and start the syslog2carmalog daemon with the following commands:
<pre>
  /etc/init.d/syslog restart
  /etc/init.d/syslog2carmalog start
</pre>

If any FAILED messages come up during this process, the syslog2carmalog provides diagnostic information to help fix the problem.

<H1> Updates </H1>

Assuming you have a CARMA and CARMA_BUILD tree, the following commands will be needed

<pre>
         1% cd $CARMA
	 2% cvs update                      # update the tree


	 3% cd $CARMA_BUILD
	 4% make all check >& LOG           # no need for 'autoreconf', due to proper dependancies 


	10% make distclean                  # if many things have changes
</pre>
