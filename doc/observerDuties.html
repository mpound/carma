By <B>Observer</B> we currently mean the person who builds a fresh carma tree
and checks out all currently possibly capabilities of the array. This process
of a weekly rotating observer was started early March 2005, with Andy Beard.
See the <A HREF=systemLog.html>Observer's Log</A> for a chronological log of how
the system changed over the course of time.

<hr>
<h1> Standard checklist </h1>
<ul> 
<li>Stop the system
<br><kbd> /opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem stop </kbd> 
<li> Make sure no processes are left running
<BR><kbd>/opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem alive</kbd>   
<li>Start system and verify that all processes are running
<br><kbd>/opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem start</kbd> 
<br>Use <kbd>/opt/rt/bin/imradmin --imr corba --tree</kbd> 
<br> and grep for any processes that are 
<kbd>Stopping</kbd> <kbd>Starting</kbd> <kbd>Stopped</kbd> or <kbd>Forked</kbd>. 
</li>
<li>If a process is stopped, try to find out why:  
    <ol><li>grep for the executable name in the logs 
    (or better yet search in the database using the Log Browser).
    </li>
    <li>Check how many times it has been respawned:<br>
    <tt>imradmin --imr corba --get-server-info <i>ProcessName</i></tt>
    </li>
    </ol>
Try restarting the process:<br>
<tt>imradmin --imr corba --reset-server <i>ProcessName</i></tt><br>
<tt>imradmin --imr corba --start-server <i>ProcessName</i></tt><br>
Note any problems in the observer's log.
</li>

<li>Check that all 16 bands of correlator data are being caught. 
<br> <kbd>/opt/rt/scripts/rtd win=wbpipeline </kbd> 
<li> Check taht all monitor data are published with 
<br> <kbd>/opt/rt/bin/dumpMonitor stats=t </kbd> 
<li> Check that sac works
<br> <kbd>/opt/rt/scripts/sac --imr corba </kbd>
 <ul> 
  <li> Set the locations and delay offsets of the ovro antennas:
  <br><tt>ovrosetup()</tt>
  </li>
  <li> Get a monitor point: 
  <br><kbd>print s.query("Carma.Ovro1.AntennaCommon.Drives.Azimuth.actualAzimuth")</kbd> 
  <br>(same thing, a shorter way):
  <br><kbd>print s.query("Carma.Ovro1.Drive.Azimuth.actualAzimuth")</kbd> 

  </li>
  <li> Delay engine self test returns 1 for success: 
  <br><kbd>print de.selfTest(0)</kbd>
  <li> Move an antenna: 
  <br><kbd>s.move(az, el, antNum)</kbd>
  <br> verify all antenna motion with 
  <br><kbd> /opt/rt/scripts/rtd->Antennas->AntennaCommon->Drives </kbd>
  </li>
  <li> Track a source: <br><kbd>s.track("sourcename")</kbd>
  <br>Print the delay to antenna 1 for this source:<br>
  <tt>print s.query("Carma.DelayEngine.DelayData1.totalDelay")</tt>
  </li>
  <li> Stow antenna: <br><kbd>s.stow(antNum)</kbd>
  </li>
 </ul>
<li> Get some recent monitor data from the database (1/2sec, 1min, astro):
<br> <b>Chul, help, help!</b>
</li>
<li> Get some recent info from the log:
<br> On database.ovro.caltech.edu:
<br><tt>scripts/rtd win=log dbName=localhost</tt>
<br>will bring up the log browser.  The realtime window is still broken,
but the database window works.  Until the database is opened
to other domains, you must log into database.ovro.caltech.edu to
view the database log window (and remote java is <b>really</b> slow).
<br>
Realtime, for now: <tt>tail -f /var/carma/accLog/control.log</tt>
</li>
<li> More database tests

<H1> Tips &amp; Tricks:</H1>

<li> Observers must login as control@acc</li>
<li> <em>Do not</em> do any development as control.</li>
<li> Note any problems/solutions in the <a href=systemLog.html>Observer's Log</a>.  (Write them in 
the file $CARMA/doc/systemLog.html in your sandbox and check it in).</li>
<li> The script /opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem (you guessed it) controls the system. It will control the processes listed in /opt/rt/conf/imr/carma.xml.</li>
<pre>
controlSystem [ start | stop | status ]
</pre>
<li> To check the running processes:
<pre>
imradmin --imr corba --tree
</pre>
Processes should be "running" or "active."  You can grep the output for 
"forked" or "stopped" to find problem processes.  You can also use
/opt/rt/scripts/imrConsole but that is slow over the internet.
</li>
<li>To update control's sandbox and install to /opt/rt:
<pre>
cd /home/control/carma
cvs update -dAP
cd /home/control/carma/build/optimized
make
[make check]
make install
</pre>
<li> When you do and update and install as control, you should tag
the tree, <em>after ensuring that it runs properly</em>. To tag
the tree:
<br>
<pre>
ssh control@acc
cd /home/control/carma
cvs tag TAGNAME
</pre>
</li>
<li>To run subarray control:</li>
<pre>
sac --imr corba
</pre>
<li> For tcsh users, "exec tcsh" creates some convenient aliases.</li>

<H1> Introduction </H1>

First some basics:
<OL>
<LI>
The carma software is distributed accross a number of machines in the
private OVRO net (<I>machine</I><B>.carma.pvt</B>). 

<LI>The account name that
controls the array and various subsystems on the various computers
is called <B>control</B> and should be used for all array control.
Some hardware access can be done by other users, correlator? weather?

<LI> The run time system ... (/opt/rt/..)

<LI>
Important directories (e.g. CARMA_TOOLS and CARMA_PKG) are all residing
on NFS shared directories, viz.
<PRE>
       CARMA_TOOLS     /opt/carmaTools         (usually a symlink to a version)
       CARMA_PKG       /sw/carma_pkg                 ?? not always present ??
</PRE>
Note: the command <B>df</B> may not show them until you have accessed the directory. This
makes it hard to remember what it's called, but such is life without .....
</OL>

<H1> Building/Updating </H1>

The first thing could do is start a fresh build, though most of the time
we use the current build in control.
<P>
It perhaps goes without saying that you should only build/update
when 
<A HREF=http://tinderbox.ovro.caltech.edu/tinderbox/carma/status.html>tinderbox</A>
looks healthy!

<H3> Fresh build </H3>


<PRE>

#tag when you do a cvs update and build as control



#To tag a properly running tree:
  ssh control@acc
  cd /home/control/carma
  cvs tag TAGNAME
</pre>

<H3> Updates build </H3>

<pre>
   exec tcsh                        # the .cshrc file contains a handy "carma" environment
   cd $CARMA_SRC
   cvs -n -q update                 # get an idea what's been updated since last check

   cd $CARMA_BUILD
   make all                         # rebuild the system


if you use bash, you don't have environment variables, so this is the other route:

   cd ~/carma
   cvs -q update -PAd
   autoreconf -i -s                  # maybe not needed, but doesn't hurt (and nice for paranoidi)
   cd build/optimized
   ./config.status --recheck         # maybe not needed, but doesn't hurt (and nice for paranoidi)
   make all                          # rebuild (all is actually the default, so "make" was enough)

</pre>


You could also check the system, with
<pre>

   make check                        # check the system, you could skip this if you're brave

</pre>

but there is perhaps a chance this might confuse the running system. So, don't run this
on a "hot" system, better shut it down first (see below).


<H1> Installing  </H1>

<PRE>

      # First the running system needs to be stopped

  /opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem stop

      # this can take a while

  make install

      # now restart the system, and this WILL take a while

  /opt/rt/scripts/controlSystem start

      # wait with any new commands until the system is given you a shell prompt
      # you may have to hit the RETURN key a few times



</PRE>

<H1> Configuring </H1>


<H1> Running </H1>

This is best done from an account that is NOT called <B>control@acc</B>, i.e.
ideally not even on the ACC. 

<PRE>
    /opt/rt/scripts/imrConsole corba.carma.pvt 

    # this command start a java console, which may take a while to appear.
    # and especially on remote links can be an exersize in patience

    imrtree

    would be a reasonable alternative to view the IMR tree

    # now check if everything looks ok, in particular the control system binary
    # on the acc.carma.pvt machine sometimes needs tbe restarted and/or reset 
    # to get it going.

    dumpMonitor list=t
    dumpMonitor component=Weather frames=1
    cd /var/carma/log
       check out:  control.log monitor.log etc.

    % ssh environment
    % ps auxw
       should see 
          /opt/carmaTools.optimize/bin/imr
	  /opt/rt/bin/frameScriberPublisher
	  /opt/rt/bin/weatherStation
	  ...
     % cd /var/carma


     ** a useful thing to know would be to restart a subsystem..., e.g. take weather.

    /opt/rt/scripts/sac --imr corba.carma.pvt

    # files in /var/carma/{log, imr, oad}
      imr:   acc_20000      acc.carma.pvt_20000
      log:   carma.log  monitor.log control.log interferometry.log alter.log

</PRE>
